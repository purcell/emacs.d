 ;;;; Commentary
 ;;
 ;; This file contains extensions for programming in Common Lisp. The
 ;; main features are:
 ;;
 ;;   A socket-based communication/RPC interface between Emacs and
 ;;   Lisp, enabling introspection and remote development.
 ;;
 ;;   The `slime-mode' minor-mode complementing `lisp-mode'. This new
 ;;   mode includes many commands for interacting with the Common Lisp
 ;;   process.
 ;;
 ;;   A Common Lisp debugger written in Emacs Lisp. The debugger pops up
 ;;   an Emacs buffer similar to the Emacs/Elisp debugger.
 ;;
 ;;   A Common Lisp inspector to interactively look at run-time data.
 ;;
 ;;   Trapping compiler messages and creating annotations in the source
 ;;   file on the appropriate forms.
 ;;
 ;; SLIME should work with Emacs 22 and 23.  If it works on XEmacs,
 ;; consider yourself lucky.
 ;;
 ;; In order to run SLIME, a supporting Lisp server called Swank is
 ;; required. Swank is distributed with slime.el and will automatically
 ;; be started in a normal installation.

 The list should have the form:

 NAME is a symbol for the implementation.
 PROGRAM and PROGRAM-ARGS are strings used to start the Lisp process.
 INIT is a function that should return a string to load and start
   Swank. The function will be called with the PORT-FILENAME and ENCODING as
   arguments.  INIT defaults to `slime-init-command'. 
 CODING-SYSTEM a symbol for the coding system. The default is

 ENV environment variables for the subprocess (see `process-environment').

 ;;;   0. Emacs recompiles/reloads slime.elc if it exists and is stale.
 ;;;   1. Emacs starts an inferior Lisp process.
 ;;;   2. Emacs tells Lisp (via stdio) to load and start Swank.
 ;;;   3. Lisp recompiles the Swank if needed.
 ;;;   4. Lisp starts the Swank server and writes its TCP port to a temp file.
 ;;;   5. Emacs reads the temp file to get the port and then connects.
 ;;;   6. Emacs prints a message of warm encouragement for the hacking ahead.
 ;;;
 ;;; Between steps 2-5 Emacs polls for the creation of the temp file so
 ;;; that it can make the connection. This polling may continue for a
 ;;; fair while if Swank needs recompilation.

 ;;;; Connections
 ;;;
 ;;; "Connections" are the high-level Emacs<->Lisp networking concept.
 ;;;
 ;;; Emacs has a connection to each Lisp process that it's interacting
 ;;; with. Typically there would only be one, but a user can choose to
 ;;; connect to many Lisps simultaneously.
 ;;;
 ;;; A connection consists of a control socket, optionally an extra
 ;;; socket dedicated to receiving Lisp output (an optimization), and a
 ;;; set of connection-local state variables.
 ;;;
 ;;; The state variables are stored as buffer-local variables in the
 ;;; control socket's process-buffer and are used via accessor
 ;;; functions. These variables include things like the *FEATURES* list
 ;;; and Unix Pid of the Lisp process.
 ;;;
 ;;; One connection is "current" at any given time. This is:
 ;;;   `slime-dispatching-connection' if dynamically bound, or
 ;;;   `slime-buffer-connection' if this is set buffer-local, or
 ;;;   `slime-default-connection' otherwise. 
 ;;;
 ;;; When you're invoking commands in your source files you'll be using
 ;;; `slime-default-connection'. This connection can be interactively
 ;;; reassigned via the connection-list buffer.
 ;;;
 ;;; When a command creates a new buffer it will set
 ;;; `slime-buffer-connection' so that commands in the new buffer will
 ;;; use the connection that the buffer originated from. For example,
 ;;; the apropos command creates the *Apropos* buffer and any command
 ;;; in that buffer (e.g. `M-.') will go to the same Lisp that did the
 ;;; apropos search. REPL buffers are similarly tied to their
 ;;; respective connections.
 ;;;
 ;;; When Emacs is dispatching some network message that arrived from a
 ;;; connection it will dynamically bind `slime-dispatching-connection'
 ;;; so that the event will be processed in the context of that
 ;;; connection.
 ;;;
 ;;; This is mostly transparent. The user should be aware that he can
 ;;; set the default connection to pick which Lisp handles commands in
 ;;; Lisp-mode source buffers, and slime hackers should be aware that
 ;;; they can tie a buffer to a specific connection. The rest takes
 ;;; care of itself.

 ;;;; Communication protocol

 ;;;;; Emacs Lisp programming interface
 ;;;
 ;;; The programming interface for writing Emacs commands is based on
 ;;; remote procedure calls (RPCs). The basic operation is to ask Lisp
 ;;; to apply a named Lisp function to some arguments, then to do
 ;;; something with the result.
 ;;;
 ;;; Requests can be either synchronous (blocking) or asynchronous
 ;;; (with the result passed to a callback/continuation function).  If
 ;;; an error occurs during the request then the debugger is entered
 ;;; before the result arrives -- for synchronous evaluations this
 ;;; requires a recursive edit.
 ;;;
 ;;; You should use asynchronous evaluations (`slime-eval-async') for
 ;;; most things. Reserve synchronous evaluations (`slime-eval') for
 ;;; the cases where blocking Emacs is really appropriate (like
 ;;; completion) and that shouldn't trigger errors (e.g. not evaluate
 ;;; user-entered code).
 ;;;
 ;;; We have the concept of the "current Lisp package". RPC requests
 ;;; always say what package the user is making them from and the Lisp
 ;;; side binds that package to *BUFFER-PACKAGE* to use as it sees
 ;;; fit. The current package is defined as the buffer-local value of
 ;;; `slime-buffer-package' if set, and otherwise the package named by
 ;;; the nearest IN-PACKAGE as found by text search (first backwards,
 ;;; then forwards).
 ;;;
 ;;; Similarly we have the concept of the current thread, i.e. which
 ;;; thread in the Lisp process should handle the request. The current
 ;;; thread is determined solely by the buffer-local value of
 ;;; `slime-current-thread'. This is usually bound to t meaning "no
 ;;; particular thread", but can also be used to nominate a specific
 ;;; thread. The REPL and the debugger both use this feature to deal
 ;;; with specific threads.

 (make-variable-buffer-local

 t means the \"current\" thread;
 :repl-thread the thread that executes REPL requests;

 the Lisp image), and is thus easily tricked to modify the wrong
 source files---which can lead to quite some stressfull cursing.

 different source root that also exists in the source root
