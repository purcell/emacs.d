1 Introduction of Wanderlust
****************************

Wanderlust is an mail/news management system on Emacsen.  It supports
IMAP4rev1(RFC2060), NNTP, POP and local message files.

   The main features of Wanderlust:

   - Pure elisp implementation.
   - Supports IMAP4rev1, NNTP, POP(POP3/APOP), MH and Maildir format.
   - Unified access method to messages based on Mew-like Folder
     Specification.
   - Mew-like Key-bind and mark handling.
   - Manages unread messages.
   - Interactive thread display.
   - Folder Mode shows the list of subscribed folders.
   - Message Cache, Disconnected Operation.
   - MH-like FCC. (Fcc: %Backup and Fcc: $Backup is allowed).
   - MIME compliant (by SEMI).
   - Transmission of news and mail are unified by Message transmitting
     draft.
   - Graphical list of folders (XEmacs and Emacs 21).
   - View a part of message without retrieving the whole message
     (IMAP4).
   - Server-side message look up (IMAP4).  Multi-byte characters are
     allowed.
   - Virtual Folders.
   - Supports compressed folder using common archiving utilities.
   - Old articles in folders are automatically removed/archived
     (Expiration).

File: wl.info,  Node: MIME Modules,  Next: Download,  Prev: Start Me Up,  Up: Start Me Up

2.1 Installing MIME modules
===========================

You must install SEMI beforehand to use Wanderlust.

   SEMI can be downloaded from following site:

     SEMI:   ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/semi/

   You need packages named APEL and FLIM to use SEMI. You can download
APEL and FLIM from following URLs:

     APEL:   ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/apel/
     FLIM:   ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/flim/

   You have to install APEL, FLIM and SEMI in this order.  Generally,
'make install' will do the job.  (In XEmacs 21, 'make install-package'.)

   Refer to the documents of each package for detailed installation
procedure (1).

   Recommended combination of APEL, FLIM and SEMI are following:

   - APEL 10.6, FLIM 1.14.6 and SEMI 1.14.6

   You can also use many other FLIM/SEMI variants.  Combination of the
latest versions should work.  For example, the following combination are
confirmed to work.

   - APEL 10.6, SLIM 1.14.9, SEMI 1.14.5
   - APEL 10.6, CLIME 1.14.5, EMIKO 1.14.1

   You have to re-install Wanderlust if you upgraded APEL, FLIM or SEMI.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

2.2 Download and Extract the Package
====================================

You can download Wanderlust package from following sites:

   Original site:
     ftp://ftp.gohome.org/wl/

   Mirrored ftp/http sites:

     http://www.jpl.org/elips/wl/
     http://www.ring.gr.jp/archives/text/elisp/wl/
     ftp://ftp.ring.gr.jp/pub/text/elisp/wl/

   Extract the obtained package to your working directory:

     % cd ~/work
     % tar zxvf wl-VERSION.tar.gz
     % cd wl-VERSION

2.2.1 To use SSL (Secure Socket Layer)
--------------------------------------

SSL (Secure Socket Layer) can be used for SMTP, IMAP, NNTP and POP
connections in Wanderlust.

   There are two ways to use SSL. One is to start SSL negotiation just
after the connection establishment (generic way).  The other one is to
start SSL negotiation by invoking STARTTLS command in the each session.

   To use the formal SSL (generic SSL), you must set 'PATH' to the
directory that OpenSSL commands are installed.

   To use the latter SSL(STARTTLS), you must install starttls package in
addition to above.  You can download starttls package from the following
site.

     ftp://opaopa.org/pub/elisp/


File: wl.info,  Node: Install,  Next: Minimal Settings,  Prev: Download,  Up: Start Me Up

2.3 Byte-compile and install
============================

2.3.1 Installation
------------------

Edit 'LISPDIR' and 'EMACS' in 'Makefile'.  Set the Emacs's command name
to 'EMACS'.  Set package installation directory to 'LISPDIR'.  Then,
please execute following commands.

     % make
     % make install

   Destination directory is auto-probed if you leave 'LISPDIR' in
'Makefile' as is.  (That is, leave it as 'NONE')

   If you are using an Emacs variant which does not merge specified
directory to 'load-path' (e.g.  Mule 2.3 based on Emacs 19.28), then you
will see the error message:

     Cannot open load file: mime-setup

In this case, either add destination directories of custom, APEL, FLIM
and SEMI to environmental variable 'EMACSLOADPATH', or define
'load-path' in 'WL-CFG' in extracted directory.

   If you want to handle shimbun folders or to use BBDB, add directory
where emacs-w3m or BBDB is installed to 'load-path'.  Then necessary
modules will be byte-compiled and installed.  *Note Shimbun Folder::,
*Note BBDB::.

2.3.2 'WL-CFG'
--------------

Contents of the file 'WL-CFG' is loaded under installation if a file
with that name exists in extracted directory.  You can use 'WL-CFG' to
configure 'load-path' to extra packages such as SEMI if needed.

   If you want to specify the install directory of Wanderlust related
files, then set following variables in 'WL-CFG'

'WL_PREFIX'
     A directory to install WL modules.  This directory is relative
     directory from 'LISPDIR'.  WL modules include 'wl*.el', 'wl*.elc'
     files.

'ELMO_PREFIX'
     A directory to install ELMO modules.  This directory is relative
     directory from 'LISPDIR'.  ELMO modules include 'elmo*.el',
     'elmo*.elc' files.

Default value of 'WL_PREFIX' and 'ELMO_PREFIX' are 'wl'.

   If you want to install ELMO related files under a sub-directory such
as "elmo" then add following to 'WL-CFG':

     (setq ELMO_PREFIX "elmo")

2.3.3 Install as a XEmacs package
---------------------------------

It is possible to install Wanderlust as one of packages of XEmacs (21.0
or later).  Configuration for autoload and icon-path in local '~/.emacs'
files are no longer necessary, if you install Wanderlust as a package.

   Follow the next example to install Wanderlust as an XEmacs package.

     % vi Makefile
     % make package
     % make install-package

   package directory is auto-probed, if SEMI is installed.  (you can
also specify it with 'PACKAGEDIR' in 'Makefile')

2.3.4 Run in place
------------------

If wl and elmo directories are defined in 'load-path', then
byte-compilation and installation are not necessary to start Wanderlust.
For example, if package is extracted in '~/work', Wanderlust can be
invoked with following setting in '~/.emacs'.

     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/work/wl-VERSION/wl")
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/work/wl-VERSION/elmo")

2.3.5 Manual
------------

Manual is described in Info format.  Please do following.

     % make info
     % make install-info

   If you install Wanderlust as a XEmacs package, Info file is already
installed too, so there are no need of these commands.

   Manual directory is automatically detected.  Of course, it can be
configured by 'INFODIR' in 'Makefile'.

   You can read manual at the following URL:

     http://www.gohome.org/wl/doc/wl_toc.html


File: wl.info,  Node: Minimal Settings,  Next: Folder Definition,  Prev: Install,  Up: Start Me Up

2.4 Set up .emacs
=================

The Wanderlust package contains two module groups.

'ELMO (elmo-*.el)'
     These modules show everything as folders.  This is the back-end for
     WL.
'WL (wl-*.el)'
     These modules controls the behavior of main body of Wanderlust.
     They are also the front-end for ELMO.

   You can customize the behavior of Wanderlust by changing the value of
environmental variables which begins with 'elmo-' and 'wl-'.

   The minimal requirement for settings is as the following.

     ;; autoload configuration
     ;; (Not required if you have installed Wanderlust as XEmacs package)
     (autoload 'wl "wl" "Wanderlust" t)
     (autoload 'wl-other-frame "wl" "Wanderlust on new frame." t)
     (autoload 'wl-draft "wl-draft" "Write draft with Wanderlust." t)

     ;; Directory where icons are placed.
     ;; Default: the peculiar value to the running version of Emacs.
     ;; (Not required if the default value points properly)
     (setq wl-icon-directory "~/work/wl/etc")

     ;; SMTP server for mail posting. Default: 'nil'
     (setq wl-smtp-posting-server "your.smtp.example.com")
     ;; NNTP server for news posting. Default: 'nil'
     (setq wl-nntp-posting-server "your.nntp.example.com")

   '~/.wl' is automatically loaded when Wanderlust starts up (if such a
file exists).  So it is convenient to gather Wanderlust specific
settings in '~/.wl'.  Settings for "face" must be written in '~/.wl',
because you can't write them in '.emacs' (if you write it to '.emacs',
you'll get an error).  *Note Highlights::.

   All above described settings except autoload configuration can be
written in '~/.wl').

2.4.1 'mail-user-agent'
-----------------------

If you write following setting in your '~/.emacs', you can start
Wanderlust draft mode by typing 'C-x m' ('compose-mail').  This means it
enables you to run Wanderlust as a default mail composer of Emacsen.

   It is effective only when your Emacs can define 'mail-user-agent'.
*Note (emacs)Mail Methods::.

     (autoload 'wl-user-agent-compose "wl-draft" nil t)
     (if (boundp 'mail-user-agent)
         (setq mail-user-agent 'wl-user-agent))
     (if (fboundp 'define-mail-user-agent)
         (define-mail-user-agent
           'wl-user-agent
           'wl-user-agent-compose
           'wl-draft-send
           'wl-draft-kill
           'mail-send-hook))


File: wl.info,  Node: Folder Definition,  Next: Start Wanderlust,  Prev: Minimal Settings,  Up: Start Me Up

2.5 Folder Definition
=====================

You can skip this section because it is possible to add/edit the
subscribe folders from the buffer for list of folders.  *Note Folder
Manager::.

   Define the folders you want to subscribe in file '~/.folders'.  The
contents written in '~/.folders' become the folders which you subscribe
to as it is.

   Format for '~/.folders' is very simple.  Here is an example:

     #
     # Lines begin with '#' are comment.
     # Empty lines are ignored
     #
     # FOLDER NAME  "FOLDER NICKNAME"
     # (nicknames are not necessary)
     #
     %inbox  "Inbox"
     +trash  "Trash"
     +draft  "Drafts"
     %#mh/Backup@my.imap.example.com "Sent"
     # Folder Group
     Emacsen{
         %#mh/spool/wl            "Wanderlust ML"
         %#mh/spool/elips         "ELIPS ML"
         %#mh/spool/apel-ja       "APEL Japanese ML"
         %#mh/spool/xemacs-beta   "XEmacs beta"
         -fj.news.reader.gnus@other.nntp.example.com "Gnus Net news"
         *-fj.editor.xemacs,-fj.editor.mule,-fj.editor.emacs "fj's Emacsen"
     }
     #
     # If folder name ends with '/', that means an 'access group',
     # all subfolders automatically included in one folder group.
     #
     %#mh/expire@localhost /
     # All MH folders are included in one folder group.
     + /

   Each line contains one folder you want to read.  The definition of
folders will be explained in detail in the next section.

   The part surrounded by 'GROUP NAME{' and '}' will become one folder
group.  One folder group is treated as a directory which can be opened
and closed in folder mode.  It is convenient for collecting some folders
and putting them in order.

   Please note that 'GROUP NAME{' and '}' occupies one line and you have
to write it that way (It is because the parser sucks).

   There are two types of groups.  One is like 'Emacsen' from above
example which the user chooses his favorite folders as a group.

   The other one is "access group" like '+ /' from above example.  It
collects all sub-folders in the folder to make a group.  (Its behavior
differs by the type of the folder.  For example, '+' followed by '/'
makes entire MH sub-directories to one group)

   This behavior is better understood if you try it and confirmed the
function first.  You can write and try a small folder definition, so you
will know the idea of the folder function before writing the real one.

2.6 Start Wanderlust
====================

If installation and configuration worked well, you can invoke Wanderlust
by typing following command in Emacs.

     M-x wl

After initialization, Folder Mode which shows the list of folders will
appear.  That means the folders you defined in the '~/.folders' are
listed.

   If you start Wanderlust with prefix argument like 'C-u M-x wl', you
can skip folder checking.

2.7 Overview
============

Basically, you will handle messages in wanderlust while you come and go
from/to each of the following buffers.  Details of each ones are
explained in following chapters.

'Folder Buffer'
     You can see the list of folders.  You can select some folder and go
     into the summary of it.  You can subscribe new folder or edit
     subscription list.
'Summary Buffer'
     You can see the list of messages in the folder.  You can select
     message and view its contents, and reply to some message.  You can
     delete ones or move ones to another folder.
'Message Buffer'
     You can see the contents of the message.  You can save part to disk
     or open in external programs.
'Draft Buffer'
     You can edit message.

3 Wanderlust's folders
**********************

This chapter describes the folder types which Wanderlust is able to
handle.

   Wanderlust uses ELMO as it's interface, so you can use every folder
types supported by ELMO.

   As of version 2.15.9, 15 types of folders are predefined.  These are
IMAP, NNTP, LocalDir(MH), Maildir, News Spool, Archive, POP, Shimbun,
Search, Multi, Filter, Pipe, File, Access and Internal folder types.

* Menu:

* IMAP Folder::                 '%' - IMAP folder
* NNTP Folder::                 '-' - NNTP folder
* MH Folder::                   '+' - MH folder
* Maildir Folder::              '.' - Maildir folder
* News Spool Folder::           '=' - News spool folder
* Archive Folder::              '$' - Archive folder
* POP Folder::                  '&' - POP folder
* Shimbun Folder::              '@' - Shimbun Folder
* Search Folder::               '[' - Search Folder
* Multi Folder::                '*' - Multi folder
* Filter Folder::               '/' - Filter folder
* Pipe Folder::                 '|' - Pipe folder
* Internal Folder::             ''' - Internal folder
* File Folder::                          - File folder
* Access Folder::                        - Access folder

3.1 IMAP Folder
===============

A folder to access e-mails via IMAP4rev1 protocol (RFC 2060).

   Format:

     '%' MAILBOX [':' USERNAME ['/' AUTHENTICATE-TYPE]]['@' HOSTNAME][':' PORT]['!']

   You can specify 'login' (encoded password transmission), 'cram-md5'
(CRAM-MD5 authentication), 'digest-md5' (DIGEST-MD5 authentication) or
'clear' (or 'nil', plain password transmission) as AUTHENTICATE-TYPE.

   default:

     USERNAME  -> The value of elmo-imap4-default-user.
                  Initial setting is USER environment variable or
                  LOGNAME environment variable or return value of
                  (user-login-name).
     AUTHENTICATE-TYPE -> The value of elmo-imap4-default-authenticate-type.
                  Initial setting is "auth".
     HOSTNAME  -> The value of elmo-imap4-default-server.
                  Initial setting is "localhost".
     PORT -> The value of elmo-imap4-default-port.
                  Initial setting is 143.

   You can omit the HOSTNAME from folder names if you set
'elmo-imap4-default-server' as your main IMAP server.  For example, you
can specify a folder as 'foo%imap@gateway' even if you have to go
through a firewall.

     ;; Example: imap4.exaple.org as main IMAP server
     (setq elmo-imap4-default-server "imap4.example.org")

   SSL (Secure Socket Layer) connection will be used if a folder name
ends with '!'.  If a folder name ends with '!!', STARTTLS connection
will be established.

   If the value of 'elmo-imap4-default-stream-type' is 'ssl', SSL will
be the default connection, i.e.  you can omit '!'.  If it is is
'starttls', STARTTLS will be the default connection.  To use normal
connection in these cases, add '!direct' at the end of folder name.

     ;; Example: Use SSL connection
     (setq elmo-imap4-default-stream-type 'ssl)

   If you specify 'login', 'cram-md5' or 'digest-md5' as authentication
method, the password is sent in encoded form.  But, if your server is
unable to receive an encoded password, authentication will fall back to
'clear' (that is, sending password in raw format) after confirmation to
user.  If 'elmo-imap4-force-login' is non-nil, authentication will fall
back to 'clear' without confirmation (default value is 'nil').

     ;; Example: password in raw format
     (setq elmo-imap4-default-authenticate-type 'clear)

   Example:

     %inbox     -> IMAP mailbox "inbox"
     %#mh/inbox -> IMAP mailbox "#mh/inbox"

     %inbox:hoge -> IMAP mailbox "inbox" of user "hoge".
     %inbox:hoge/clear@server1
                 -> server1's IMAP mailbox "inbox"
                    of user "hoge", with plain password authentication
                    ('clear).

3.1.1 International mailbox names (Modified UTF7)
-------------------------------------------------

You can use international mailbox names in MAILBOX part, if you are
using Emacs with UTF-7 support and 'elmo-imap4-use-modified-utf7' is set
to non-nil value (default value is 'nil').

   Currently, Mule-UCS package is required to use UTF-7.  Mule-UCS works
on following Emacsen.

   * Emacs 20.3 or later
   * XEmacs 21.2.37 or later

   You can obtain Mule-UCS package from following URL.

3.2 NNTP Folder
===============

A folder to access USENET news via NNTP protocol (RFC 977).  One
newsgroup is treated as a folder.

   Format:

     '-' NEWSGROUP [':' USERNAME]['@' HOSTNAME][':' PORT]['!']

   default:
     HOSTNAME  -> The value of elmo-nntp-default-server.
                  Initial setting is 'localhost'.
     USERNAME  -> The value of elmo-nntp-default-user.
                  Initial setting is nil.
     PORT      -> The value of elmo-nntp-default-port.
                  Initial setting is 119.

   AUTHINFO is used as authentication method if the USERNAME is non-nil.
SSL connection will be used if a folder name ends with '!'.  If a folder
name ends with '!!', STARTTLS connection will be established.

   If the value of 'elmo-nntp-default-stream-type' is 'ssl', SSL will be
the default connection, i.e.  you can omit '!'.  If it is is 'starttls',
STARTTLS will be the default connection.  To use normal connection in
these cases, add '!direct' at the end of folder name.

   Example:

     -fj.rec.tv            -> Newsgroup 'fj.rec.tv'.
     -fj.rec.tv@newsserver -> Newsgroup 'fj.rec.tv' on 'newsserver'.


File: wl.info,  Node: MH Folder,  Next: Maildir Folder,  Prev: NNTP Folder,  Up: Folders

3.3 MH Folder
=============

A folder to access MH format mail (1 file is 1 mail).

   Format:

     '+' DIRECTORY-NAME

   Normally, DIRECTORY-NAME is an relative path to the variable
'elmo-localdir-folder-path' (default is '~/Mail'), but if it starts with
'/' or '~', then it is treated as an absolute path (this is also true
for drive-letters).

   Message number is used for the name of the message file.

   Example:

     +inbox         -> ~/Mail/inbox
     +from/teranisi -> ~/Mail/from/teranisi
     +~/test        -> ~/test


File: wl.info,  Node: Maildir Folder,  Next: News Spool Folder,  Prev: MH Folder,  Up: Folders

3.4 Maildir Folder
==================

A folder to access Maildir format (1 file is 1 mail).

   Format:

     '.' [DIRECTORY-NAME]

   Normally, DIRECTORY-NAME is a relative path to the variable
'elmo-maildir-folder-path' (default is '~/Maildir'), but if it starts
with '/' or '~', then it is treated as an absolute path (this is also
true for drive-letters).

   Maildir contains 'cur', 'new' and 'tmp' subdirectories.  Messages are
contained in the 'cur' directory.  All message files in the 'new'
directory are moved to 'cur' directory when you access the folder.  All
message files contained in the 'tmp' directory and not accessed for 36
hours are deleted.

   This behavior conforms to the <http://cr.yp.to/proto/maildir.html>.

   Example:

     .              -> ~/Maildir
     .inbox         -> ~/Maildir/inbox
     .from/teranisi -> ~/Maildir/from/teranisi
     .~/test        -> ~/test


File: wl.info,  Node: News Spool Folder,  Next: Archive Folder,  Prev: Maildir Folder,  Up: Folders

3.5 News Spool Folder
=====================

This folder handles locally saved news articles which are proposed by
Mew/IM. You can also read articles directly from a spool-file which is
retrieved by an utility like 'gnspool'.

   Format:

     '=' DIRECTORY-NAME

   DIRECTORY-NAME is a sub-directory to the directory defined by
variable 'elmo-localnews-folder-path' (default is '~/News') You can use
'.' as directory delimiter as well as '/'.

   Example:

     =fj/os/os2         -> ~/News/fj/os/os2
     =fj.os.bsd.freebsd -> ~/News/fj/os/bsd/freebsd


File: wl.info,  Node: Archive Folder,  Next: POP Folder,  Prev: News Spool Folder,  Up: Folders

3.6 Archive Folder
==================

This method can handle archive files, which are compressed by utilities
such as Info-ZIP or LHA, as one folder.

   Format:

     '$' PATH-NAME [';' ARCHIVER-TYPE ';' PREFIX]

   PATH-NAME is the relative path from 'elmo-archive-folder-path'
(initial setting is '~/Mail').  If PATH-NAME begins with '/' or '~' or
'drive-letter of DOS', PATH-NAME is treated as absolute path.  ange-ftp
format is also permitted under the environment of ange-ftp, efs.

   The actual file name of the archive folder is 'elmo-archive-basename'
(Initial setting is 'elmo-archive') under the PATH-NAME.  If a file
named PATH-NAME exists, it is treated as folder.  The suffix is
automatically decided for ARCHIVER-TYPE.

   If ARCHIVER-TYPE is omitted, 'elmo-archive-default-type' (Initial
setting is 'zip') is referred.

   PREFIX specifies the internal directory structure of the archive.
For example, if the ML server is fml, 'msend.tar.gz' has a structure
like 'spool/1', so you have to specify 'spool' as PREFIX.

   Example:

     $teranisi         -> ~/Mail/teranisi/elmo-archive.zip
     $bsd/freebsd;lha  -> ~/Mail/bsd/freebsd/elmo-archive.lzh
     $/foo@server:~/bar;zoo     -> ~/bar/elmo-archive.zoo on ftp server
     $d:/msend.tar.gz;tgz;spool -> d:/msend.tar.gz
     $ml;zip/        -> Access group consists of archive folders
                        under ~/Mail/ml

File: wl.info,  Node: Archiver,  Next: Archive Tips,  Prev: Archive Folder,  Up: Archive Folder

3.6.1 Supported Archives
------------------------

By default, following archives are supported.

             LHA, Info-ZIP/UNZIP, ZOO, RAR  ;; full-access
             GNU TAR('tgz, 'tar)            ;; read-only

   If your archiver can include multiple files in one archive, you have
a possibility use it as an archiver of Wanderlust (ARJ/UNARJ, ARC is one
of the candidate.  TAR is supported read-only because it cannot delete
file in the archive ('mv')).

   'gzip', 'bzip', 'bzip2' cannot be used as an archiver of Wanderlust
because they cannot include multiple files.  Archivers that cannot
extract files to standard output are also not supported.

3.6.2 OS specific information about archiver.
---------------------------------------------

Behaviors of the following archivers are confirmed by further
experiences.  ('*' mark means recommended archiver).

     [OS/2]  Warp4.0J(w/o VoiceType)+Fx00505/emx0.9c(fix04)/PMMule,EmacsPM

   * Caution about LHA

   If you are an OS/2 user, Peter Fitzsimmons's LH/2 is not supported.
Hiramatsu version of LHA is only supported.  In Win32, LHa32 is only
supported (DOS version is no good).

   * Caution about GNU tar

   You have to take care about GNU tar's version because many version
has problem on deleting file from archive.

   Please test '--delete' '-f' options work.  Otherwise, your archive
will be destroyed.  No problem is reported on above versions of GNU tar.


File: wl.info,  Node: Archive Tips,  Next: Archive Vars,  Prev: Archiver,  Up: Archive Folder

3.6.3 TIPS
----------

For comfortable migration, usage of 'wl-summary-archive' (*note
Archive::) or Expire (*note Expire::) is recommended.  To treat archive
folders created by expiration, you must set non-nil value to
'elmo-archive-treat-file'.

   On the OS/2, there is a great difference between Mule2.3(19.28) and
Emacs20.2 in processing speed.  For comfortable use, Emacs20 is
recommended.  (If re-search's performance is the problem, 19.3x or later
may be okay.)

   If many files are included in one archive, it takes long time to
access the archive folder because archiver starting overhead is
increased (especially LHA). 150-200 messages in one archive is
recommended.

   Of course, following is possible :-) (meanings of these variables are
described later.)

     (setq wl-fcc "$backup")
     (setq wl-trash-folder "$trash;lha")


File: wl.info,  Node: Archive Vars,  Prev: Archive Tips,  Up: Archive Folder

3.6.4 Variables About Archive Folder
------------------------------------

'elmo-archive-default-type'
     The initial setting is 'zip'.  Set archiver type by symbol.

'elmo-archive-TYPE-method-alist'
     Define archiver TYPE's methods.  (TYPE is 'lha', 'zip', 'zoo',
     'tgz' etc) Each element of the alist is following.

          (ACTION . (EXEC-NAME OPTIONS))   ;; external program and its option.
          (ACTION . FUNCTION)              ;; function

     Currently available actions are following.

          'ls, 'cat ('cat-headers)        ;; Minimal setting(read-only)
          'mv ('mv-pipe), 'rm ('rm-pipe)  ;; full-access (with above)
          'cp ('cp-pipe)                  ;;

     In above actions, actions enclosed with braces are optional (They
     are used for better performance).

'elmo-archive-suffix-alist'
     An alist of archiver-type (symbol) and suffix.

'elmo-archive-file-regexp-alist'
     An alist of a regexp to get file number from list output of
     archiver and archiver-type (symbol).

'elmo-archive-method-list'
     A list of elmo-archive-TYPE-method-alist (TYPE is a symbol of
     archiver-type).

'elmo-archive-lha-dos-compatible'
     The initial setting is 't' on OS/2 and Win32.  If non-nil, LHA is
     DOS (Mr.  Yoshizaki original) compatible.

'elmo-archive-cmdstr-max-length'
     The initial setting is 8000.

     Max length of command line argument for external archiver program.
     Emacs does not have a limit of command line byte length, but some
     OS (e.x OS/2) have.  It depends on the OS. Archive folder is
     affected by this limit because it calls external archiver program
     directly (not called via shell).  For example, you cannot delete
     messages if archiver program must receive larger bytes of arguments
     to delete.  OS/2 have a command line argument limit of 8190 bytes,
     so we defined default as 8000 with some margin.

     However, you don't have an influence of command line argument limit
     if the archiver has 'actions' to receive target file information
     from standard input ('rm-pipe', 'mv-pipe', 'cat-headers' action).


File: wl.info,  Node: POP Folder,  Next: Shimbun Folder,  Prev: Archive Folder,  Up: Folders

3.7 POP Folder
==============

A folder to access e-mails via POP3 protocol (RFC 1939).

   Format:

     '&' [USERNAME]['/' AUTHENTICATE-TYPE][':' NUMBERING-METHOD]['@' HOSTNAME][':' PORT]['!']

   You can specify 'user' (plain password transmission) or 'apop' (APOP
authentication) as AUTHENTICATE-TYPE.

   You can specify 'uidl' (use UIDL command for message numbering) or
'list' (use LIST command for message numbering) as 'numbering-method'.

   default:
     USERNAME   -> The value of elmo-pop3-default-user.
                   Initial setting is USER environment variable or
                  LOGNAME environment variable or return value of
                  (user-login-name).
     AUTHENTICATE-TYPE -> The value of elmo-pop3-default-authenticate-type.
                   Initial setting is 'user'.
     NUMBERING-METHOD -> Follow the value of elmo-pop3-default-use-uidl.
                   If t, use UIDL for numbering. Initial setting is t.
     HOSTNAME   -> The value of elmo-pop3-default-server.
                   Initial setting is 'localhost'.
     PORT       -> The value of elmo-pop3-default-port.
                   Initial setting is 110.

   Example:

     &hoge@localhost     -> access localhost as user 'hoge'.
     &hoge@popserver:109 -> access the server "popserver" on port 109
                             as user 'hoge'.

   To use apop as an AUTHENTICATE-TYPE, 'md5.el' is needed (XEmacs
doesn't need 'md5.el').  'md5.el' is included in 'utils/sasl/lisp/' or
Emacs/W3 package (<http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/docs.html>) or LCD
archive (GPL2).

   If the last character of the folder name is '!', Wanderlust connects
to the POP server via SSL (Secure Socket Layer).  If a folder name ends
with '!!', STARTTLS connection will be established.

   If the value of 'elmo-pop3-default-stream-type' is 'ssl', SSL will be
the default connection, i.e.  you can omit '!'.  If it is is 'starttls',
STARTTLS will be the default connection.  To use normal connection in
these cases, add '!direct' at the end of folder name.

3.8 Shimbun Folder
==================

A folder for watching "shimbun" (means "newspaper" in Japanese), news
site and mailing list archives on WWW by using emacs-w3m
(<http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/>).

   You should possess w3m and emacs-w3m to use this.

   Format:

     '@' MODULE-NAME '.' FOLDER-NAME

   Admissible values of MODULE-NAME and FOLDER-NAME are described in
'README.shimbun.ja' distributed with emacs-w3m.

   Example:

     @airs.wl  -> archive of wanderlust ML (using module sb-airs.el)
     @asahi/   -> access group of all folders in module sb-asahi.el

3.8.1 Variables About Shimbun Folder
------------------------------------

'elmo-shimbun-update-overview-folder-list'
     The initial setting is 'all'.  Specify a set of folders to update
     overview when messages are fetched.  Specify 'all' to update
     overview in all shimbun folders.  You can specify a list of regular
     expressions of shimbun folder names to restrict affected folders.

     Example:

          (setq elmo-shimbun-update-overview-folder-list
                '("^@airs\\." "^@namazu\\."))

     Update summary view automatically after fetching.

3.9 Search Folder
=================

A folder to access messages found by an external program with some
condition.

   Format:

     '[' SEARCH CONDITION ']' [ SEARCH TARGET [ '!' SEARCH ENGINE ] ]

   The format of the SEARCH CONDITION and SEARCH TARGET depend on the
SEARCH ENGINE.

3.9.1 Supported search engines
------------------------------

Supported search engines are following ones.  Default search engine can
be assigned by 'elmo-search-default-engine'.

* Menu:

* namazu::      namazu
* grep::        grep
* mu::          mu
* notmuch::     notmuch


File: wl.info,  Node: namazu,  Next: grep,  Prev: Search Folder,  Up: Search Folder

3.9.2 namazu
------------

The messages registered in the namazu-index is found by using namazu
(<http://www.namazu.org/>).

   SEARCH CONDITION is a query of namazu.  Please refer to the document
of the attached to namazu for details.

   SEARCH TARGET is a namazu-index used for search.  The directory with
the index or the alias that explain in the following can be specified.
Default value of the path of namazu index can be assigned by
'elmo-search-namazu-default-index-path'.

   Example:

     [wanderlust]           -> search messages matched with
                            "wanderlust" from the default index
     [semi flim]~/Mail/semi -> search "semi flim" from the index
                            in the directory "~/Mail/semi"

3.9.2.1 Enter space to separate keywords
........................................

If you want to use space in folder entry, 'C-q <SPC>' will help you.

3.9.2.2 Alias name for index
............................

You can define an alias name for index.

   Example:

     (setq elmo-search-namazu-index-alias-alist
           '(("cache" . "~/.elmo/cache")
             ("docs" . "~/documents")))

   Above definition defines two index aliases.  You can specify

     [wanderlust]cache

   to execute a namazu search with keyword 'wanderlust' using a index in
the directory '~/.elmo/cache'.

3.9.2.3 Multiple indices
........................

You can specify a list for 'elmo-search-namazu-default-index-path' and
'elmo-search-namazu-index-alias-alist'.  When list is specified, all
index contained in the list is used as the namazu indices.

   Example:

     (setq elmo-search-namazu-index-alias-alist
           '(("all" . ("~/.elmo/cache" "~/documents"))
             ("cache" . "~/.elmo/cache")))

   Using above alias setting, you can specify

     [wanderlust]all

   to execute a namazu search with keyword 'wanderlust' using indices in
the directory '~/.elmo/cache' and '~/documents'.


File: wl.info,  Node: grep,  Next: mu,  Prev: namazu,  Up: Search Folder

File: wl.info,  Node: Filter Folder,  Next: Pipe Folder,  Prev: Multi Folder,  Up: Folders

3.11 Filter Folder
==================

A folder to access virtual folder which collects all messages that
satisfy a condition.

   Format:

     '/' CONDITION '/' TARGET-FOLDER

   In the CONDITION part, you can specify following.

  1. Partial filter: 'first:NUMBER', 'last:NUMBER'

     first: NUMBER messages are picked from top of folder.  last: NUMBER
     messages are picked from bottom of folder.

     Example:

          /last:10/-fj.os.linux -> Latest 10 messages from -fj.os.linux are picked.
          /first:20/%inbox      -> First 20 messages from %inbox are picked.

  2. Date filter: 'since:DATE', 'before:DATE'

     since: only messages arrived since DATE are picked (DATE is
     included).  before: only messages arrived before DATE are picked
     (DATE is not included).

     You can specify following as DATE.

          yesterday ->  a day before today.
          lastweek  ->  same day of last week.
          lastmonth ->  same day of last month.
          lastyear  ->  same day of last year.
          NUMBERdaysago -> NUMBER days ago. (e.x. '3daysago')
          DAY-MONTH-YEAR -> specify date directly (ex. 1-Nov-1998)

     Example:

          /since:3daysago/+inbox -> messages arrived since 3 days ago in +inbox
                                    are picked.
          /before:yesterday/+inbox -> messages arrived before yesterday in +inbox
                                    are picked.

  3. Field filter: 'FIELD:VALUE'

     All messages that have FIELD and its value is VALUE are picked.
     FIELD and VALUE are case insensitive.

     Example:

          /from:teranisi/+inbox -> In +inbox, messages which have From: field
                                   and its value includes "teranisi" string are picked.
          /body:foo/%inbox      -> In %inbox, messages which have "foo" text
                                   are picked.

  4. Flag filter: 'flag:FLAG-NAME'

     Pick up messages with flag specified by FLAG-NAME.

     You can specify following flag names:

          unread    -> unread
          important -> important
          answered  -> replied
          forwarded -> forwarded
          digest    -> unread or important
          any       -> unread or replied or forwarded or global-flag.

     You can also use flags which you have set as 'global-flag'.
     global-flag is a flag which has arbitrary name.  You can put
     global-flag on messages by invoking 'wl-summary-set-flags' (Key
     <F>).  By default, 'important' flag is prepared.  You can view
     messages with global-flag by visiting the subfolder of ''flag'
     folder.

     *Note Internal Folder::.

     Example:

          /flag:digest/%inbox     -> a folder consist of unread or important
                                     message in %inbox.
          /flag:wl/+ML/Wanderlust -> a folder consist of messages with global flag
                                     wl in +ML/Wanderlust.

  5. Compound condition

     A condition starting with '!' indicates a negation.  If you combine
     conditions by character '|', it is considered as OR condition.  '&'
     is considered as AND condition, likewise.  Condition can be grouped
     by parentheses ('(', and ')').

     '/tocc:xxxx/' is an abbreviation of '/to:xxxx|cc:xxxx/'.
     '/!tocc:xxxx/' is an abbreviation of '/!to:xxxx&!cc:xxxx/'.

     Example:

          /from:teranisi&!to:teranisi/+inbox
                                -> In +inbox, messages are picked if the message's
                                   From: field includes "teranisi" and
                                   To: field doesn't include "teranisi".

          /tocc:"Yuuichi Teranishi"/+inbox
                                -> In +inbox, messages are picked if the
                                   message's To: field or Cc: field includes
                                   "Yuuichi Teranishi".

          /(from:yt|from:teranisi)&subject:report/+inbox
                                -> In +inbox, messages are picked if the message's
                                   From: field includes "yt" or "teranisi", and
                                  Subject includes "report".

Tip for string description:

   Space character, '"', '/',')','|' and '&' should be enclosed with '"'
in VALUE string.  ('"' should be escaped with '\' in it).  You can
enclose the string with '"' even it does not contain these characters.

Advanced example:

     *%inbox,/from:teranisi/%inbox@server
            -> Messages in %inbox or
               message is in the %inbox@server folder and it's From field
               includes "teranisi" are collected.

     /last:100//to:teranisi/*+inbox,%inbox
            -> Latest 100 messages which is in the +inbox or %inbox folder
               and To: field matches "teranisi".

     /from:hogehoge//last:20//tocc:teranisi/%#mh/inbox@localhost
            -> Pick messages which have From: field and it includes "hogehoge"
               from latest 20 messages in the %#mh/inbox@localhost
               and To: or Cc: field includes "teranisi".

3.12 Pipe Folder
================

In the pipe folder, messages are automatically transferred from the
source folder to destination folder.

   Format:

     '|' SOURCE-FOLDER '|' DESTINATION-FOLDER

   When you access the pipe folder, messages are automatically
transferred from SOURCE-FOLDER to DESTINATION-FOLDER.  It is convenient
if you want to download messages to local disk via POP. For example, if
you specify following

     |&username@popserver|+inbox

and access it, Wanderlust downloads messages from '&username@popserver'
to '+inbox' automatically.

   On the other hand, if you put '|:' instead of second '|', then
messages are copied to the destination folder (not deleted from
source-folder).  At the next time you access that folder, copies new
messages only.

     '|' SOURCE-FOLDER '|:' DESTINATION-FOLDER

   If you want to copy messages from POP server and view them, specify
the folder as follows:

     |&username@popserver|:+inbox

   where messages will be kept on the server.

   Example:

     |%inbox|%myinbox   -> Download %inbox to %myinbox.
     |*&user@popserver1,&user@popserver2|+inbox
              -> Download from &user@popserver1 and &user@popserver2 to +inbox.
     |-gnu.emacs.sources|:+sources
              -> Copy messages from -gnu.emacs.sources to +sources.

   After messages are moved, a hook 'elmo-pipe-drained-hook' is called.


File: wl.info,  Node: Internal Folder,  Next: File Folder,  Prev: Pipe Folder,  Up: Folders

3.13 Internal folder
====================

A folder to access internal messages of Wanderlust.

   Format:

     ''flag' ['/' GLOBAL-FLAG]
     ''sendlog'
     ''cache/00' - ''cache/1F'

   A folder named ''flag' is a special virtual folder which collects
messages which have GLOBAL-FLAG.

   There is 'important' flag defined as GLOBAL-FLAG by default.  You can
review important messages at once after you put important marks on the
messages in the different folders.  If GLOBAL-FLAG is omitted, it is
treated as 'important' flag is specified.

   In addition, in summary mode, to be described later, you can freely
define global flags and put them on messages.  *Note Usage of Summary
Mode::.

   In this folder, if you delete message, GLOBAL-FLAG put on the message
is removed.  If you append messages to this folder, the message will
have GLOBAL-FLAG.

   A folder named ''sendlog' is a virtual folder which collects cached
messages which are recoded on '~/.elmo/sendlog'.  It might be useful
when you forgot to add cc for yourself.  To use this, you should set
'wl-draft-use-cache' to non-nil so that sent messages are cached.

   You can access cached messages fetched via network by accessing
folders named ''cache/00' - ''cache/1F'.  00 - 1F are the name of the
subdirectories of the cache directory ('~/.elmo/cache').

3.14 File folder
================

File Folder gives the view for local file system.  The one File Folder
corresponds to the one directory.

   Format:

     'file:' PATH-OF-THE-DIRECTORY

   Example:

     file:~/work     -> ~/work
     file:/etc       -> /etc


File: wl.info,  Node: Access Folder,  Prev: File Folder,  Up: Folders

3.15 Access folder
==================

A folder to access virtual folder which collects messages from a root
folder and subfolders of one.  The add and remove of the subfolder is
automatically reflected.

   Format:

     'access:' ROOT-FOLDER

   Example:

     access:%INBOX -> All subfolders of IMAP mailbox "inbox".
     access:'cache -> All of 'cache folder

4 Folder mode
*************

After you start Wanderlust, folder mode is appeared firstly.  It
contains folder list you subscribed.  You can select and edit folders in
this mode.

4.1 Selecting Folder
====================

4.1.1 Usage (TIPS)
------------------

4.1.1.1 Check new, unread number
................................

Folder mode looks like this.  (In XEmacs, it looks much nicer ;-))

     [-]Desktop:14186/35580/67263
        Inbox:3/10/10
        Trash:2/7/10
        Drafts:0/0/3
        Sent:0/9/348
        [-]Emacsen:0/34/4837
          Wanderlust ML:0/0/558
          ELIPS ML:0/0/626
          tm:0/0/821
          XEmacs Beta:0/29/255
          Mew:0/0/998
          Mule-Win32:0/0/1491
          fj's Emacsen:0/5/88

   Each line means:

     FOLDER-NAME:NEW-NUMBER/UNREAD-NUMBER/ALL-NUMBER

's' key on the folder line updates these numbers.  It changes its color
if it has many new messages.

   The whole folder mode is a folder group named 'Desktop'.  Folder
group open/close by return key.  A operation to a folder group is
treated as operations on the children folders.  For example, when you
type 's' on '[-]Emacsen', six children folders update its unread number
status.

4.1.1.2 Select Folder
.....................

To enter summary mode of the folder, type return (or space) key on the
folder line.  If the variable 'wl-stay-folder-window' has non-nil value,
summary window appears on the right of the folder mode window.

4.1.2 Key bindings
------------------

Folder mode's key binding (related to selecting folders) is following.

'<SPC>'
'<RET>'
     Enter to the summary mode of the folder at the current cursor
     point.  With prefix argument, enter the sticky summary.  If the
     cursor is on the top of folder group line, the folder group is
     opened or closed.  When the cursor is on the access group and this
     command is called with prefix argument, folder children list is
     updated to the newest one.  (Children list is updated recursively
     if the access folder has hierarchical structure.)
     ('wl-folder-jump-to-current-entity')

'M-<RET>'
     Folder children list of the access group at the current cursor
     point is updated to the newest one.  (Children list is updated
     recursively if the access folder has hierarchical structure.)
     ('wl-folder-update-recursive-current-entity')

'w'
     Create a new draft message.  ('wl-draft')

'W'
     If the current cursor point is on the NNTP folder, create a new
     draft message which already has 'Newsgroups:' field.  If the
     current cursor point is on the folder for mailing list (refile
     destination), create a new draft message which already has 'To:'
     field with guessed mailing list address (If
     'wl-subscribed-mailing-list' is valid list).
     ('wl-folder-write-current-folder')

'C-c C-o'
     Move to the draft buffer if available.  If multiple draft buffer
     exists, moved to one after another.  If prefix argument is
     specified, load draft folder's message to the draft buffer and jump
     to it.  ('wl-jump-to-draft-buffer')

's'
     Update new and unread number information of the folder at the
     current cursor point.  ('wl-folder-check-current-entity')

     Update summary information of the folder at the current cursor
     point.  ('wl-folder-sync-current-entity')

'r s'
     Update new and unread number information of the folders in the
     currently selected region.  ('wl-folder-check-region')

'r S'
     Update summary information of the folders in the currently selected
     region.  ('wl-folder-sync-region')

'Z'
     Sync up address book status with '~/.addresses''s content.
     ('wl-status-update')

'P'
     Jump cursor to the folder which have unread messages on the upward

     downward from current cursor point.  ('wl-folder-next-unread')

'p'
     Move cursor to the folder on the previous line.
     ('wl-folder-prev-entity')

'n'
     Move cursor to the folder on the next line.
     ('wl-folder-next-entity')

'J'
     Jump to the folder specified by the user input.
     ('wl-folder-jump-folder')

'I'
     Prefetch new messages of the folder at the current cursor point by
     'wl-summary-incorporate'.  If the cursor is on the folder group, it
     is executed recursively.  ('wl-folder-prefetch-current-entity')

'c'
     Mark all unread messages of the folder at the current cursor point
     as read.  If the cursor is on the folder group, it is executed
     recursively.  ('wl-folder-mark-as-read-all-current-entity')

'f'
     Enter summary mode of the first unread folder.
     ('wl-folder-goto-first-unread-folder')

     ('wl-folder-pick')

'o'
     All unread folder is opened.  ('wl-folder-open-all-unread-folder')

'x'
     Execute marks in summary buffers.  *Note Sticky Summary::.
     ('wl-execute-temp-marks')

'/'
     Folder group is opened/closed.  ('wl-folder-open-close')

'['
     All folder group is opened.  ('wl-folder-open-all')

']'
     All folder group is closed.  ('wl-folder-close-all')

'q'
     Quit Wanderlust.  ('wl-exit')

'M-t'
     Toggle Wanderlust's offline/online status.  ('wl-toggle-plugged')

'C-t'
     Start Wanderlust's plug-status manager.  ('wl-plugged-change')

4.1.3 Customize variables
-------------------------

'wl-folders-file'
     The initial setting is '~/.folders'.  Subscribed folders are
     described (saved) in this file.

'wl-folder-info-save'
     The initial setting is 't'.  If non-nil, unread information is
     saved and used in the next Wanderlust session.

'wl-stay-folder-window'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  If non-nil, summary window is
     appeared on the right side of the folder buffer.

'wl-folder-window-width'
     The initial setting is 20.  Folder mode's window width when
     'wl-stay-folder-window' is non-nil.

'wl-folder-use-frame'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  If non-nil, use new frame for the
     folder window.

'wl-folder-many-unsync-threshold'
     The initial setting is 70.  If the number of unread messages is
     more than this value, folder color is changed.

'wl-highlight-folder-by-numbers'
     This option controls how to highlight each line in the folder
     buffer.  The default value is 't', highlighting with various colors
     based on the message numbers.  If it is 'nil', highlighting with
     various colors based on the folder status.  In addition, if it is a
     number (e.g.  1), highlighting will be done based on both the
     message numbers and the folder status.

'wl-folder-desktop-name'
     The initial setting is 'Desktop'.  The name of top folder group.

'wl-folder-petname-alist'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  An alist of folder's realname and
     its nickname.

'wl-folder-access-subscribe-alist'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.

     Control automatic subscribing and unsubscribing of the children
     list of access groups.

     Each element is:

          (REGEXP-OF-ACCESS-FOLDER . (SUBSCRIBE-FLAG REGEXP-OF-FOLDERS ...))

     If SUBSCRIBE-FLAG is non-nil, folders which have name matched to
     REGEXP-OF-FOLDERS are displayed.  Otherwise, hidden.  However,
     already unsubscribed folder is not displayed even when the
     SUBSCRIBE-FLAG is non-nil.  Multiple REGEXP-OF-FOLDERS can be
     specified.

     Example:

          '(("^-fj$" . (t   "^-fj\\.\\(comp\\|editor\\|mail\\)"
                            "^-fj\\.\\(net\\|news\\|os\\|rec\\)"))
            ("^-$" . (t   "^-\\(fj\\|tnn\\|japan\\|gnu\\|comp\\)"))
            ("^\\+ml$" . (nil "^\\+ml$" "^\\+ml/tmp")))

'wl-folder-hierarchy-access-folders'
     A list of regular expressions for access groups which creates
     children folder list hierarchically.

     For example, if you specify 'wl-folder-hierarchy-access-folders'
     like following,

          (setq wl-folder-hierarchy-access-folders
               '("^-[^\\.]*$" "^-comp.unix$" "^-comp.unix.bsd$"))

     you obtain the access group hierarchy as follows.

             [-]-:912/912/3011
               [-]-fj:674/674/1314
                 -fj.comp.announce:0/0/2
                 -fj.comp.dev.cdrom:0/0/0
                 ...
               [+]-japan:238/238/1688
               [-]-comp:0/0/4
                 [-]-comp.unix:0/0/0
                   -comp.unix.admin:0/0/0
                   -comp.unix.dos-under-unix:0/0/0
                   -comp.unix.programmer:0/0/0
                   [-]-comp.unix.bsd:0/0/23
                     -comp.unix.bsd.freebsd.announce:0/0/0
               ...

     If you opened '-' in this example, only the direct children is
     created ('-fj', '-japan', '-tnn', ...).  second hierarchy
     ('-fj.comp.announce', ..., '-comp.unix', ...) is not created until
     the children access group is opened.

4.2 Editing Folders
===================

As described before, subscribed folder list is saved in '~/.folders'
file.  But you don't have to edit '~/.folders' directly.  You can
append, delete, edit folders from folder mode.

4.2.1 Usage (Tips)
------------------

4.2.1.1 Append Folder
.....................

'm a' appends new folder to your folder list.  If you enter non-existent
folder, it will ask you to create a new one.  'm g' appends new folder
group.  To append new folder to this group, firstly open it, then
execute append command in the next line.

4.2.1.2 Edit Folder
...................

You can cut folder by 'C-k', paste by 'C-y'.  Thus, you can change
folder position as if you were editing a normal file.

4.2.1.3 Create Multi Folder.
............................

  1. Type 'm q' to clear 'wl-fldmgr-cut-entity-list'.
  2. Cut folder by 'C-k' or copy folder by 'M-c'.
  3. Type 'm m', then you can create multi folder.

4.2.1.4 Delete Nickname, Filter
...............................

You can delete nickname or filter by putting ""(NULL) from the
minibuffer while appending.

4.2.1.5 Append Folder to Empty Group
....................................

To append new folder to the empty folder group (after you create folder
group by typing 'm g'), firstly open it, then execute append command in
the next line.  If it is closed, folder is appended on the same level
with the folder group above.  It is difficult to explain by words so try
it.  In other words, appended position depends on the open/close status
of the upper one.

4.2.1.6 Charset of the Folders File.
....................................

'wl-mime-charset' is used for saving 'wl-folders-file'.

4.2.1.7 Create Filter
.....................

'm f' adds filter to the folder at the current cursor point.  To create
new filter folder and leave the current folder unchanged, copy it 'M-c',
make filter 'm f' and paste it 'C-y'.  Multiple filter can be specified
while appending filter.  If you put ""(NULL), filter is deleted.

4.2.1.8 Sort Folders
....................

Sorting of the folders is executed by the function specified by
'wl-fldmgr-sort-function'.  The initial setting is
'wl-fldmgr-sort-standard', which sorts alphabetically.  Sorting affects
only on the current folder group.  It does not affect on the child
groups.

4.2.1.9 Hiding Folders in the Access Group
..........................................

Usually, access group displays all children folders, but you can set
some folders hidden.  Following operations are only available on access
group.

   Command 'wl-fldmgr-unsubscribe' ('u') toggles the visibility
(subscribe/unsubscribe) of the folder at current cursor point.  Against
this, 'wl-fldmgr-unsubscribe-region' ('U') hides folders in the
specified region.

   Note that 'wl-fldmgr-unsubscribe-region' does not toggle while
'wl-fldmgr-unsubscribe' toggles.  These two commands accept prefix
argument and if the argument has positive number, the unsubscribe it.
If the prefix argument has negative value, folder becomes visible and if
zero, folder visibility is toggled.

   The other commands, 'wl-fldmgr-subscribe' and
'wl-fldmgr-subscribe-region' are also prepared (not binded to the key).

   Moreover, if 'wl-fldmgr-cut' or 'wl-fldmgr-cut-region' is executed in
the access group, they have a same effect with 'wl-fldmgr-unsubscribe'
and 'wl-fldmgr-unsubscribe-region'.  The difference is that cut commands
deletes folders from the current buffer.

4.2.1.10 Operations in the Access Group
.......................................

You can insert and delete folders in the access group like usual folder
group.  But insert and delete commands can be only available for the
children folders of the access group and they only sets the subscribe
status.  In other words, insertion of the folder means subscribing,
deletion means unsubscribing.  (1)

   To update the access group when children folders are inserted or
deleted by other way (other than Wanderlust), open the access group by
typing 'C-u <RET>'.  *Note Selecting Folder::.

   The order of children folders of access group is saved after
insertion/deletion/sorting.  If you set 'wl-force-fetch-folders' to
non-nil or open access group by typing 'C-u <RET>', disappeared folders
are deleted and newly created folders are inserted on the top of the
access group.

4.2.2 Key bindings
------------------

Key bindings on the folder mode related to folder editing are shown
below.  All bindings starts with 'm', and primary commands are binded to
one stroke key binding.

'm a'
     Add specified folder to your folder list .  If you enter
     non-existent folder, create it after confirmation.

4.2.3 Customize variables
-------------------------

'wl-interactive-save-folders'
     The initial setting is 't'.  If non-nil and folder view is
     modified, confirm saving it before Wanderlust or Emacs exits.  If
     'nil', save without confirmation.

'wl-fldmgr-make-backup'
     The initial setting is 't'.  If non-nil, '~/.folders.bak' is
     created before saving the folder status.

'wl-fldmgr-sort-function'
     The initial setting is 'wl-fldmgr-sort-standard'.  A function to
     sort folders.  By default function, folders are sorted
     alphabetically and folder group is put on top (when
     'wl-fldmgr-sort-group-first' is non-nil).

'wl-fldmgr-sort-group-first'
     The initial setting is 't'.  If non-nil, 'wl-fldmgr-sort-standard'
     precedes folder group.  If 'nil', it does not care whether it is
     folder group or not.

'wl-folder-check-async'
     The initial setting is 't'.  If non-nil, check folder's unread
     status asynchronously.  It boosts newsgroup checking.

'wl-folder-check-fast'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  If non-nil, it does not update
     folder status while checking.
'wl-folder-notify-deleted'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  If non-nil, negative value is
     displayed when the message is deleted.  If 'sync', folder is
     synchronized when the message is deleted.  If 'nil', message
     deletion is ignored.

'wl-fldmgr-add-complete-with-current-folder-list'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  Non-nil means call
     'elmo-folder-list-subfolders' and get completion candidate for
     'wl-fldmgr-add'.

4.2.4 Miscellanea
-----------------

Following is a note for folder editing.

  1. cut or copy stacks the folder in the 'wl-fldmgr-cut-entity-list'.
     paste(yank) command pastes the folders on one cut or copy command
     (If copy command is executed by region, folders in the region are
     pasted by one paste command)

  2. You cannot cut 'Desktop' group.  Also, you cannot paste folders at
     the outside of the 'Desktop'.

  3. You cannot copy folder group.

  4. Operations on the access group are only available for the folders
     in the same access group.

  5. You cannot create a folder which has same name with the folders
     already exist.

  6. You cannot insert folders which have same name in one group.  You
     can insert them in the different groups.  You cannot put same
     nickname to the different folders.

File: wl.info,  Node: Usage of Summary Mode,  Next: Thread Operations,  Prev: Summary,  Up: Summary

5.1 Usage (Tips)
================

5.1.1 Summary Content
---------------------

In the summary mode, messages are displayed like following.

       377  09/16(Wed)11:57 [+1: Takuro Kitame  ] Bug?
       381  09/17(Thu)00:16 [+3: Fujikazu Okuni ] elmo-lha.el -- LHA interface
       384  09/17(Thu)01:32 [+1: Yuuichi Terani ] wl-0.6.2
       389 N09/18(Fri)01:07 [+2: Yuuichi Terani ] wl-0.6.3

   Each line displays:

     MESSAGE NUMBER, TEMPORAL MARK, PERSISTENT MARK, DATE, SENDER, SUBJECT

If you want to know how to change the format for this, please refer the
section format of Summary lines.  *Note Summary View::.

   MESSAGE NUMBER is the message's unique number in the folder.  In the
NNTP folder, it is article number, in the IMAP folder, it is UID and in
the MH folder, it is the filename of the message.

   TEMPORAL MARK and PERSISTENT MARK are described later.

   DATE is displayed like 'MONTH/DAY(WEEK DAY)HOUR:MINUTE'.  Default
setting displays week day in Japanese, but if you want to display it in
English, set the value of 'wl-summary-weekday-name-lang' as 'en'.

   SENDER's indentation corresponds to the depth of the thread.  Sender
name is displayed as nickname if it is defined in the address book.  Set
'wl-use-petname' as 'nil', if you want to quit displaying with nickname.

   If number is printed at the head of SENDER part like '+2', that means
the message have 2 follow messages.

   SUBJECT is the 'Subject:' header field of the message.  If the
message have same 'Subject:' with the parent message, it is not
displayed.  Some mailing list puts its sequence number in the 'Subject:'
field, but it is ignored.  'wl-summary-no-subject-message' is displayed
when the message has empty subject field.

5.1.2 Temporary Marks
---------------------

There are seven temporary marks, '*', 'd', 'D', 'o', 'O', 'i' and '~'.
Temporary marks indicates message operations.

'*'
     Target mark.  You can execute a command on the all messages that
     have '*' mark, with the key bindings which begins with 'm'.

'd'
     The mark to dispose.  You can put 'd' by typing 'd' key.

'D'
     The mark to force delete.  You can put 'D' by typing 'D' key.

'o'
     The mark to refile.  After you type 'o' key, prompt appears to
     input refile destination.  Your answer is printed in the summary
     line.

'O'
     The mark to refile.  You can put this mark by typing 'O' key.  The
     difference between this mark and refile mark is, this mark does not
     delete the message while latter does.

'i'
     The mark to prefetch reserved.  You can put this mark by typing 'i'
     key.

'~'
     The mark to resend reserved.  After you type '~' key, prompt
     appears to input address to resend.  Your answer is printed in the
     summary line.

   'x' key executes action for temporary marks, respectively.

5.1.3 Persistent Marks
----------------------

There are ten persistent marks, '!', 'N', 'n', 'U', 'u', 'A', 'a', 'F',
'f' and '$'.

   The persistent mark indicates the message's status and it is saved.
Each persistent mark indicates:

'N'
     It is new message.
'n'
     It is new message.  It differs from 'N' that message with 'n' is
     already cached.
'U'
     It is unread message.
'u'
     It is unread message.  It differs from 'U' that message with 'u' is
     already cached.
'!'
     It is message already read.  It differs from message without mark
     that message with '!' is not cached yet.
'A'
     It is already replied message.
'a'
     It is already replied message.  It differs from 'A' that message
     with 'a' is already cached.
'F'
     It is already forwarded message.
'f'
     It is already forwarded message.  It differs from 'F' that message
     with 'f' is already cached.
'$'
     It is a message with some global flag.  It is convenient to put
     this mark on the messages to remember (If you want to remember to
     write a reply for the message, for example) because this mark
     remains after you exited Emacs.  Messages with the '$' mark can be
     reviewed in the ''flag' folder even the message itself is deleted
     in the actual folder.  You can put global flag by typing '$' or 'F'
     key.

'None'
     If the message is read and cached (or local message),there are no
     persistent mark.

   'N', 'U', '!', 'A', 'F' indicates that the message have no cache.
Messages with the marks other than these, you can read them in the
offline status even they are in the IMAP folder or netnews folder.

   Among messages with persistent marks, ones with marks specified by
'wl-summary-expire-reserve-marks' are excluded from the expiration (as a
function of wanderlust) explained later.  *Note Expire and Archive::.

5.1.4 How To Read
-----------------

Basically, you can read messages only typing space key again and again.

   To update summary status to the newest status (synchronize), type 's'
key.

   You can jump to next unread message by typing 'N' key, and 'n' key
moves cursor to the next message.  Enter message buffer by typing 'j'
key.  To operate multipart, you have to enter to the message buffer.
*Note Message::.

5.1.5 Pack the Message Numbers
------------------------------

You can pack the message numbers in Summary by 'M-x
wl-summary-pack-number'.  Note that only MH Folder, News Spool Folder
and Maildir Folder are supported folder types.


File: wl.info,  Node: Thread Operations,  Next: Cache,  Prev: Usage of Summary Mode,  Up: Summary

5.2 Thread Operations
=====================

For example, the following line indicates one thread (a context of a
topic).

       384  09/17(Thu)01:32 [+1: Teranishi       ] wl-0.6.2

If you type '/' on this line, the thread is opened and it changes the
appearance like following.

       384  09/17(Thu)01:32 [ Teranishi          ] wl-0.6.2
       388  09/17(Thu)22:34 +-[ Murata san         ]

   (Message 388 is the replied message to the message 384.)  If you type
'/' key once again, the thread is closed.  With prefix argument, '/'
opens all children threads.

   If you type '[', opens all threads in summary.  ']' closes all
threads.

   Commands with the key binding that begins with 't' executes commands
on the messages in the thread.  *Note Key Bindings of Summary::.

5.2.1 reconstruct thread by hand
--------------------------------

You can reconstruct the thread manually.  In Summary, 'M-w'
('wl-summary-save-current-message') at the corresponding message, and
'C-y' ('wl-summary-yank-saved-message') at the new parent message then
you have the reconstructed thread.


File: wl.info,  Node: Cache,  Next: Auto Refile,  Prev: Thread Operations,  Up: Summary

5.3 Cache
=========

5.3.1 Cache File
----------------

The messages which have to access via network (e.x.  IMAP, NNTP folder)
are cached as a local file so as to save network traffic or to enable
off-line operation.  The cache file is saved under the directory
'~/.elmo/cache'.  To expire cache, type 'M-x elmo-cache-expire-by-size'.
The command deletes cache files to the specified size by the order of
last accessed time.

5.3.2 Buffer Cache and Prefetching
----------------------------------

The messages that are read are kept in the cache buffer so as to make
the behavior fast when you are to read the message again.  It is called
'buffer cache'.  The number of cache buffer is specified by
'wl-message-buffer-cache-size'.

   There are message prefetching mechanism in the Wanderlust that
prefetches next message while you are reading.

   You can control the message prefetching mechanism by these two
variables.

'wl-message-buffer-prefetch-folder-type-list'
     The initial setting is ''(imap4 nntp)'.  If it is a list of folder
     types, it specifies the folder types in which message prefetching
     is enabled.  In initial setting, messages are prefetch only in the
     nntp and imap4 folders.  In this case, multi folder that contains
     localdir and imap4 prefetches only imap4 messages.  This variable
     precedes the value of 'wl-message-buffer-prefetch-folder-list'.  To
     prefetch messages in all folder types, specify 't'.

'wl-message-buffer-prefetch-folder-list'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  A list of regexp of folders to
     enable message prefetching.

'wl-message-buffer-prefetch-depth'
     The initial setting is 1.  The number of messages for automatical
     prefetch.

'wl-message-buffer-prefetch-idle-time'
     The initial setting is 1 (in seconds).  The period of automatical
     prefetch.

'wl-message-buffer-prefetch-threshold'
     The initial setting is 30000 (bytes).  If prefetching message has
     larger size than this value, Wanderlust does not prefetch
     automatically.  If 'wl-message-buffer-prefetch-threshold' is 'nil',
     the message is not checked for the size.

'wl-auto-prefetch-first'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  If non-nil, first message is
     automatically prefetched to the buffer when you enter the folder.


File: wl.info,  Node: Auto Refile,  Next: Sticky Summary,  Prev: Cache,  Up: Summary

5.4 Auto Refile
===============

You can refile messages automatically, by typing 'C-o'
('wl-summary-auto-refile').  It decides destination of refile by the
content of the message header information (information in the msgdb).

   By default, 'From:', 'Subject:', 'To:' and 'Cc:' is available.  If
you want to decide destination by other header fields, set the variable
'elmo-msgdb-extra-fields' like following.

     (setq elmo-msgdb-extra-fields
           '("x-ml-name"
             "reply-to"
             "sender"
             "mailing-list"
             "newsgroups"))

By this setting, Wanderlust saves extra fields in the msgdb.  You have
to type 's all' to get extra fields for the messages that are already
exists in the summary.

   Then, specify the refile rule.  The refile target folder of auto
refiling is decided by the value of 'wl-refile-rule-alist'.
'wl-refile-rule-alist' is a list of a rule:

     (FIELD (REGEXP . TARGET)
            (REGEXP . TARGET)
            ...)

   Each rule means 'if FIELD value matches REGEXP, then refile to TARGET
folder'.  The rule matched first is applied.

   FIELD is a string of field name.  You can specify a list of field
name string, too.  In this case, if one of these fields is matched, then
the rule is fired (i.e.  OR condition).

   REGEXP is a regular expression for field value.  TARGET is a target
folder string.  You can specify a rule at TARGET part, too.  In this
case, If the field value of the rule and the current rule is matched,
then the current rule is fired (i.e.  AND condition).

   You can refer matched substring of REGEXP to specify TARGET part.  To
refer substring, use following keys:

'\&'
     means substitute original matched text.

'\N'
     means substitute what matched the Nth '\(...\)'.  (N is a number.)

   Following is an example of 'wl-refile-rule-alist'.

     (setq wl-refile-rule-alist
           '(("x-ml-name"
              ("^Wanderlust" . "+wl")
              ("^Elisp" . "+elisp"))
             (("To" "Cc")
              ("\\([a-z]+\\)@gohome\\.org" . "+\\1"))
             ("From"
              ("me@gohome\\.org" . ("To" ("you@gohome\\.org" .
                                         "+from-me-to-you"))))))

   After these settings, refile marks are automatically put on the
condition matched messages by typing 'C-o' ('wl-summary-auto-refile').

   Messages which have 'wl-summary-auto-refile-skip-marks' is skipped
auto refiling.  By default, 'N', 'U' and '!' is specified, so the
messages with these persistent marks are not automatically refiled.  It
means Wanderlust does not execute auto refile on unread messages by the
default setting.  To execute auto refile on all messages, set following.

     (setq wl-summary-auto-refile-skip-marks nil)


File: wl.info,  Node: Sticky Summary,  Next: Summary View,  Prev: Auto Refile,  Up: Summary

5.5 Sticky Summary
==================

The buffer of the 'sticky summary' does not killed by typing 'q'.

   By entering the summary by typing 'Shift RET' in Folder mode or 'G'
in some suummary sticky summary buffer is created.  Also typing 'M-s'
('wl-summary-stick') on the normal summary makes current one sticky.

   The buffer name of the sticky summary becomes like
'Summary:FOLDER-NAME'.  You can visit the sticky summary at any time by
'C-x b' ('switch-to-buffer'), or you can go round summary buffers by
'C-c C-n' ('wl-summary-previous-buffer') and 'C-c C-p'
('wl-summary-next-buffer') in summary mode.

   In sticky summary, the summary buffer is preserved after 'g' or 'q'.
To delete sticky summary, type 'C-u q' to exit or move to another
summary by 'C-u g'.  Other operations in the sticky summary are same as
normal summary.

   'wl-summary-always-sticky-folder-list' specifies the folders that are
automatically stuck.


File: wl.info,  Node: Summary View,  Next: Mark and Action,  Prev: Sticky Summary,  Up: Summary

5.6 Format of summary lines
===========================

You can alter the format of lines in Summary mode.

   Summary line format is specified by 'wl-summary-line-format'.  You
can use control strings defined by 'wl-summary-line-format-spec-alist'.

   An example follows.

     ;; number temporary-mark persistent-mark date branch
     ;; [ (number-of-children) sender ] subject
     (setq wl-summary-line-format "%n%T%P%M/%D(%W) %t%[%17(%c %f%) %] %s")

   Where the number set the column number of the field.  If negative
value, the column is filled from right.  If the number begins with '0',
'0' is used for filling columns instead of ' '.

   Example:

     %5n   -> `1    '
     %-05n -> `00001'

   Major control strings defined by 'wl-summary-line-format-spec-alist'
are displayed in the following list.

     %n  message number
     %T  temporary mark
     %P  persistent mark
     %Y  year
     %M  month
     %D  day
     %W  day of week
     %h  hour
     %m  minute
     %t  branch of the thread
     %[  [ (< for re-connected child)
     %]  ] (> for re-connected child)
     %f  sender
     %s  subject
     %S  size
     %c  +number-of-children: (display only for opened thread)
     %C  [+number-of-children] (display only for opened thread)
     %#  mailing list information (`(' ML-name [ ` ' ML-number ] `)')
     %l  number in the mailing list
     %@ `@' only if the first MIME part is multipart/mixed
     %~  ` ' only if previous column is not empty

   The temporary mark ('%T') and persistent mark ('%P') must appear at
the constant column.  For example, if you specify '%T' or '%P' after the
'%t', which changes its length by thread position, marks are not treated
correctly.

   If the format string is enclosed by '%number(' and '%)', the column
of the enclosed region is justified to the 'number'.  Multiple level
'%number(' parenthesis can be defined.  It is useful to justify the
column of the multiple control strings.  For example, in the above
'wl-summary-line-format',

     %17(%c %f%)

   means "Adjust number-of-children and sender string to the 17 column".

   You can specify the format by each folders with
'wl-folder-summary-line-format-alist'.  Please set regular expression
for folder names and summary line format as the following example.

     (setq wl-folder-summary-line-format-alist
           '(("^%" . "%T%P%M/%D(%W)%h:%m %t%[%17(%c %f%) %] %s")
             ("^+" . "%n%T%P%M/%D %[ %17f %] %t%C%s")))

5.6.1 on the format for sender name
-----------------------------------

The format string '%f' displays the return value of the function
specified by 'wl-summary-from-function'.  If you use the function
'wl-summary-default-from' (default), it displays sender name ordinarily,
while displays the recipient names if the folder name matches with
'wl-summary-showto-folder-regexp' and the sender is yourself.  If the
value of 'wl-use-petname' is Non-nil, it uses petname to display.

   For example, to display recipient names for the message in '+backup'
if its sender is yourself, set up as follows.

     (setq wl-summary-showto-folder-regexp "^\\+backup$")

5.7 Temporary marks and their effect
====================================

You can define temporary marks and corresponding procedure by
'wl-summary-mark-action-list'.  Initially, refile ('o'), copy ('O'),
dispose ('d'), delete ('D'), prefetch ('i') and resend ('~') are
defined.

   Each element of 'wl-summary-mark-action-list' consists of

     ('MARK' 'SYMBOL'
      'ARGUMENT-FUNCTION' 'SET-MARK-FUNCTION' 'EXEC-FUNCTION'
      'FACE' 'DOC-STRING')

   'MARK' is a temporary mark string, and 'SYMBOL' is the name of the
action to be defined.  'ARGUMENT-FUNCTION' is a function to generate
argument to be given to 'SET-MARK-FUNCTION', which will be described
next, and it takes arguments:

     ('ACTION' 'NUMBER')

   Where 'ACTION' equals to 'SYMBOL', and 'NUMBER' is message number.
'SET-MARK-FUNCTION' is a function to be called when the mark is put.  It
takes arguments:

     ('NUMBER' 'MARK' 'DATA')

   Where 'NUMBER' is target message number, 'MARK' is a temporary mark
string, and 'DATA' is given by 'ARGUMENT-FUNCTION'.

   'EXEC-FUNCTION' is a function to be called when the action is
executed.  Its argument is a list of 'MARK-INFO'.  Here 'MARK-INFO'
means a list consists of

     ('NUMBER' 'MARK' 'DATA')

   'FACE' is a face to be used for highlighting.

'wl-summary-indent-length-limit'
     The initial setting is 46.  Specify the limit of thread indent
     level.  'nil' means unlimited indent level.  If you set this to
     'nil' you should set 'wl-summary-width' to 'nil', too.

'wl-summary-max-thread-depth'
     The initial setting is 15.  If thread depth of the message is
     larger than this value, the thread is divided.

'wl-summary-recenter'
     The initial setting is t.  If non-nil, cursor point is moved to the
     center of the summary window.

'wl-summary-max-thread-depth'
     The initial setting is 30.  If thread depth is larger than this
     value, divide it.

'wl-summary-divide-thread-when-subject-changed'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  If non-nil, thread is split if the
     subject is changed.

'wl-summary-search-via-nntp'
     The initial setting is 'confirm'.

     If non-nil and 'wl-summary-jump-to-msg-by-message-id' failed, call
     'wl-summary-jump-to-msg-by-message-id-via-nntp' and search message
     from the NNTP server 'elmo-nntp-default-server'.  The value of
     'elmo-nntp-default-user', 'elmo-nntp-default-port',
     'elmo-nntp-default-stream-type' are used.

     If 'confirm', server name can be specified.  You can specify NNTP
     folder format like '-:username@servername:119!'.

'wl-summary-keep-cursor-command'
     The initial setting is the list shown below:

          (wl-summary-goto-folder wl-summary-goto-last-visited-folder)

     When you entered to summary by these commands and the target
     summary buffer already exists, summary status is not automatically
     updated and cursor position is saved.

'elmo-folder-update-threshold'
     The initial setting is 500.  If updated message number is larger
     than this value, confirm whether drop them or not (in the case
     where the value of 'elmo-folder-update-confirm' is non-nil).

'elmo-folder-update-confirm'
     The initial setting is 't'.  If the value is non-nil, do check with
     'elmo-folder-update-threshold'.

'wl-summary-always-sticky-folder-list'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.
     'wl-summary-always-sticky-folder-list' specifies the folders that
     are automatically stuck.  Each element is regexp of folder name.

'wl-summary-reserve-mark-list'
     The initial setting is the list shown below:

          ("o" "O" "D" "d" "i")

     If a message is already marked as temporal marks in this list, the
     message is not marked by any mark command.

'wl-summary-skip-mark-list'
     The initial setting is the list shown below:

          ("D" "d")

     If a message is already marked as temporal marks in this list, the
     message is skipped at cursor move.

'elmo-message-fetch-threshold'
     The initial setting is 30000 (bytes).  If displaying message has
     larger size than this value, Wanderlust confirms whether fetch the
     message or not (in the case where the value of
     'elmo-message-fetch-confirm' is non-nil).

'elmo-message-fetch-confirm'
     The initial setting is 't'.  If the value is non-nil, do check with
     'elmo-message-fetch-threshold'.

'wl-prefetch-threshold'
     The initial setting is 30000 (bytes).  If prefetching message has
     larger size than this value and 'wl-prefetch-confirm' is non-nil,
     Wanderlust confirms whether prefetch the message or not.  If
     'wl-prefetch-threshold' is 'nil', the message is prefetched without
     confirmation.

'wl-prefetch-confirm'
     The initial setting is 't'.  If non-nil, Wanderlust confirms
     whether prefetch the message or not if the message has larger size
     than 'wl-prefetch-threshold'.

'elmo-imap4-use-cache'
     The initial setting is 't'.  If non-nil, messages read via IMAP4
     are cached.

'elmo-nntp-use-cache'
     The initial setting is 't'.  If non-nil, messages read via NNTP are
     cached.

'elmo-pop3-use-cache'
     The initial setting is 't'.  If non-nil, messages read via POP3 are
     cached.

'elmo-shimbun-use-cache'
     The initial setting is 't'.  If non-nil, messages read in Shimbun
     folders are cached.

'wl-summary-resend-use-cache'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  If non-nil, messages are resend
     using cache even in the offline status.  Note that if you use
     cache, the message identity is not guaranteed.

'wl-folder-process-duplicates-alist'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  This list determines how to deal
     with duplicated messages in the same folder.  Each item in the list
     is regexp of folder name and action; you can specify any one of the
     following in the place of action:

          nil : do nothing for duplicated messages.
          hide : hide duplicated messages from the summary.
          read : set duplicated messages as read.

     Following is an example (hide duplicated messages in multi folders)

          (setq wl-folder-process-duplicates-alist
                           '(("^\\+draft$" . nil) ("^\\+trash$" . nil)
                             ("^\\*.*" . hide) (".*" . read)))

'wl-summary-flag-alist'
     The initial setting is as follows:

          ((important "orange"))

     Specify the color and the mark of message in summary buffer with
     flag.  If the mark are omitted, the mark specified in the variable
     'wl-summary-flag-mark' is assumed.  If multiple global flags are on
     one message, the former flag in this list is preferred.

     Example:

          (setq wl-summary-flag-alist
                '((important "purple")
                  (todo "red")
                  (business "green" "B")
                  (private "blue" "X")))

'wl-summary-display-mime-mode-list'
     The initial setting is the list shown below:

          (mime as-is)

     The function 'wl-summary-toggle-mime' switch specification of MIME
     analysis in the order of this list.  You can specify one of the
     follows.

          mime        : Header and body are decoded.
          header-only : Only header is decoded.
          as-is       : Header and body are not decoded.

6 Message Buffer
****************

Message Buffers utilize MIME-View mode of SEMI. For operational
procedures and key bindings, refer to respective documents.  *Note
(mime-ui-en)MIME-View::.  You can also see help by '?' in message
buffer.

   'p' at the top of a message or 'n' at the bottom of a message brings
you back to Summary mode.  'l' toggles display of Summary mode buffer.

6.1 Key Bindings
================

'l'
     Toggles display of Summary buffer.
     ('wl-message-toggle-disp-summary')

'Button-2'
     Assumes 'Message-ID:' at the mouse pointer, and shows the
     corresponding message if found.
     ('wl-message-refer-article-or-url')

'Button-4 (upward movement of a wheel)'
     Scrolls the message backwards.  When the top of the message is hit,
     moves to the previous message.  ('wl-message-wheel-down')

'Button-5 (downward movement of a wheel)'
     Scrolls the message forward.  When the bottom of the message is
     hit, moves to the next message.  ('wl-message-wheel-up')

'D'
     Delete the part under cursor.  In fact it appends modified message
     to the current folder then moves old one to trash folder.
     Therefore the message number will be changed.
     ('wl-message-delete-current-part')

6.2 Customizable Variables
==========================

'wl-message-window-size'
     Initial setting is '(1 . 4)'.  It is a cons cell and the ratio of
     its car and cdr value corresponds to the ratio of Summary and
     Message windows.

'wl-message-ignored-field-list'
     Initial setting is 'nil'.  All fields that match this list will be
     hidden in message buffer.  Each elements are regexp of field-name.
     If 'nil', the value of 'mime-view-ignored-field-list' is used.

'wl-message-visible-field-list'
     Initial setting is 'nil'.  All fields that match this list will be
     display in message buffer.  Each elements are regexp of field-name.
     This value precedes 'wl-message-ignored-field-list'.  If 'nil', the
     value of 'mime-view-visible-field-list' is used.

'wl-message-sort-field-list'
     Initial setting is '("Return-Path" "Received" "^To" "^Cc"
     "Newsgroups" "Subject" "^From").  Header fields in message buffer
     are ordered by this value.  Each elements are regexp of field-name.

'wl-message-truncate-lines'
     The initial value is the value of 'default-truncate-lines'.  If it
     is non-nil, truncate long lines in message buffer.

'wl-message-auto-reassemble-message/partial'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  If non-nil, automatically reassemble
     fragments of the message on displaying when its MIME media type is
     message/partial.

7.1.2 Editing Message Header
----------------------------

You can freely edit header region above '--text follows this line--',
until you invoke the sending operation.

   Initially, the cursor is at the 'To:' field.  Fill in recipients
addresses.  '<TAB>' completes them.

   You can use following headers to specify recipients.  Add some of
them by yourself.  Field names can be completed by '<TAB>'.

'Newsgroups:'
     Specify newsgroups to which you post the news article.

'Cc:'
     Specify addresses to send a copy (Carbon Copy) of the message.

   Following ones are removed from the header contents before sending.

'Bcc:'
     Specify addresses to send a copy (Blind Carbon Copy) of the
     message.

'Fcc:'
     Specify folders in which a copy of the message is saved.

'Ecc:'
     Specify recipients to send encapsulated copy of the message.

   You can add initial headers by following variables.

'wl-fcc'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  If non-nil, the value of this
     variable is inserted as a 'Fcc:' of the draft when it is prepared.
     If function is specified, its return value is used.

'wl-bcc'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  If non-nil, the value of this
     variable is inserted as a 'Bcc:' of the draft when it is prepared.

7.1.3 Editing Messages and Sending
----------------------------------

As a matter of course, editing message body can be performed in the same
way as usual writing.  You may write message body under '--text follows
this line--' line.  (NOTE: Be sure to leave the line '--text follows
this line--' intact.)

   Multi-part editing utilize MIME edit mode of SEMI. For procedures of
editing, refer to respective documents.  *Note (mime-ui-en)MIME-Edit::.
You can also see help by 'C-c C-x ?' in draft buffer.

   If you save the draft buffer you are editing, it is appended to the
folder specified by 'wl-draft-folder'.  You can leave draft buffer after
storing it for future editing by 'C-c C-z' ('wl-draft-save-and-exit').

   If you have finished editing, you can send message by 'C-c C-c'.


File: wl.info,  Node: Dynamical Message Re-arrangement,  Next: Template,  Prev: Editing Message Body and Sending,  Up: Usage of Draft Mode

7.1.4 Dynamic Modification of Messages
--------------------------------------

You can set 'wl-draft-config-alist' so that header and body of the
message will automatically modified depending on information of header
and others.

   The initial setting of 'wl-draft-config-alist' is 'nil'.

   In the example below, the header is modified when
'wl-draft-send-and-exit' or 'wl-draft-send' is invoked.  You can set
'wl-interactive-send' to non-nil so as to confirm changes before sending
the message.

     (setq wl-draft-config-alist
           '(((string-match "aaa\\.example\\.com$" (system-name))
              ;; applied if the expression is non-nil
              (wl-smtp-posting-server . "mailserver-B")
              (wl-nntp-posting-server . "newsserver-B")
              ;; settings of temporary variables
              )
             ("^To: .*user@aaa\\.bbb\\.example\\.com"
              ;; applied if it matches the header of the draft buffer
              ("Organization" . (format "Go %s" my-webpage)))
                            ;; you can write elisp expressions here (eval only)
              (top . "Hello.\n")    ;; inserted at the top of the body
              (bottom . "\nBye.\n") ;; inserted at the bottom of the body
             ))

   The format of 'wl-draft-config-alist' is:

     '(("REGEXP OF THE HEADER" or ELISP EXPRESSION
       ("FIELD" . value(ELISP EXPRESSION))
        (VARIABLE . value(ELISP EXPRESSION))
        (SUB-FUNCTION . value(ELISP EXPRESSION))
        FUNCTION
        ...)
       ("REGEXP OF THE HEADER" or ELISP EXPRESSION
        ("FIELD" . value(ELISP EXPRESSION))
        ...))

   Per default, there are 13 following sub-functions.

     'header:      Inserts the specified string at the bottom of the header.
     'header-top:  Inserts the specified string at the top of the header.
     'header-file: Inserts the specified file at the bottom of the header.
     'x-face:      Inserts 'X-Face:' field with the content of the specified file.
     'top:         Inserts the specified string at the top of the body.
     'top-file:    Inserts the specified file at the top of the body.
     'body:        Replaces the body with the specified string.
                   Specifying nil deletes the entire body string.
     'body-file:   Replaces the body with the content of the specified file.
     'bottom:      Inserts the specified string at the bottom of the body.
     'bottom-file: Inserts the specified file at the top of the body.
     'part-top:  Inserts the specified string at the top of the current part.
     'part-bottom: Inserts the specified string at the bottom of the current part.
     'template:    Applies the specified template.
                   (refer to the next subsection)

   These are defined in 'wl-draft-config-sub-func-alist' and you can
change them or add your own functions.  If you read the code, you can
easily find how to write the functions.

   At the first of each item, A REGULAR EXPRESSION OF THE HEADER or an
ELISP EXPRESSION should be specified.  In the case of an elisp
expression, the item is applied when the expression is evaluated
non-nil.

   Per default, when multiple items match or are evaluated non-nil, all
such items are applied, but if you set a variable
'wl-draft-config-matchone' to 't', only the first matching one is
applied.

   At the second of the item, a cons or a list of functions should be
specified.  The car part of the cons should be a header field, a
variable, or a sub-function.  When a header field is specified, the
field will be modified.  If a variable is specified, the value of the
variable will be modified temporarily.

   In the cdr part of a cons, not only a variable but also an elisp
expression can be specified as is.  If the car part is a header field
and the cdr part is 'nil', the field will be deleted.

   See the next example as well:

     (setq wl-draft-config-alist
           '((reply                         ;; (1)
              "X-ML-Name: \\(Wanderlust\\|emacs-mime-ja\\|apel-ja\\)"
              ;; applied if it matches the header of the buffer being replied
              (body . "  Hello.\n")
              (template . "default")
              )))

   As in the (1) above, if a header regexp is prepended with 'reply', it
is applied when the draft is prepared by 'wl-summary-reply' for example,
and when it matches the header being replied.  It is ignored when there
is no buffer being replied, like after 'wl-draft' was invoked.

   If you want to use name of parent folder, you can refer the buffer
local variable 'wl-draft-parent-folder'.  In the following example,
Wanderlust changes From according to the folder name of the summary in
which the draft was invoked.

     (setq wl-draft-config-alist
           '(((string-match \".*@domain1$\" wl-draft-parent-folder)
              (\"From\" . \"user@domain1\"))
             ((string-match \".*@domain2$\" wl-draft-parent-folder)
              (\"From\" . \"user@domain2\"))))

   Note that 'wl-draft-config-alist' is applied only once when
'wl-draft-send-and-exit' or 'wl-draft-send' is invoked.  Therefore, if
you want to apply 'wl-draft-config-alist' again after aborting
transmission, execute 'C-c C-e' ('wl-draft-config-exec') explicitly.

   If you don't want to apply 'wl-draft-config-alist' when
'wl-draft-send-and-exit' or 'wl-draft-send' is invoked, do the
following:

     (remove-hook 'wl-draft-send-hook 'wl-draft-config-exec)

   If you want to apply 'wl-draft-config-alist' when a draft buffer is
prepared, do the following:

     (add-hook 'wl-mail-setup-hook 'wl-draft-config-exec)

   If you want to apply 'wl-draft-config-alist' when you re-edit a mail
from summary mode by typing 'E'('wl-summary-reedit'), do the following:

     (add-hook 'wl-draft-reedit-hook 'wl-draft-config-exec)


File: wl.info,  Node: Template,  Next: POP-before-SMTP,  Prev: Dynamical Message Re-arrangement,  Up: Usage of Draft Mode

7.1.5 Inserting Templates
-------------------------

Set a variable 'wl-template-alist', and type 'C-c C-j' or 'M-x
wl-template-select' in the draft buffer.

   The format of 'wl-template-alist' is almost the same as
'wl-draft-config-alist'.  *Note Dynamical Message Re-arrangement::.

     (setq wl-template-alist
           '(("default"
              ("From" . wl-from)
              ("Organization" . "Example Co.Ltd.")
              (body . "Hello.\n"))
             ("report"
              (template . "default")                 ;; (a)
              ("To" . "boss@example.com")
              ("Subject" . "Report")
              (body-file . "~/work/report.txt")
              )
             ))

   As you can see, the only difference is item (template) names such as
'default' and 'report', instead of a regexp of header.  Because
definition of each item is the same as 'wl-draft-config-alist', you can
call another template, like (a).

   Executing the command 'wl-template-select' results in template
selection, but the result differs depending on variable
'wl-template-visible-select'.

   If 'wl-template-visible-select' is 't' (default), a buffer window is
shown below the draft buffer.  You can select a template by 'n' and 'p'
seeing the buffer window.

   Press the <RET> key and the template is actually applied to the draft
buffer.  If you press 'q', nothing is applied.  In addition, you can
adjust the window size by 'wl-template-buffer-lines'.

   If 'wl-template-visible-select' is 'nil', you should type the name of
the template in the mini buffer.

   If 'wl-template-select' is executed with prefix argument, inversed
value of 'wl-template-visible-select' is used.

   As shown in the example in 'wl-draft-config-alist', you can select
'default' template by writing:

     (template . "default")

7.1.6 Sending mail by POP-before-SMTP
-------------------------------------

You can send mail by POP-before-SMTP. Necessary setting is

     (setq wl-draft-send-mail-function 'wl-draft-send-mail-with-pop-before-smtp)

to change mail posting function from its default value
'wl-draft-send-mail-with-smtp'.  Also you would configure following
variables on demand.

'wl-pop-before-smtp-user'
     The POP user name for POP-before-SMTP authentication.  If unset,
     'elmo-pop3-default-user' is used.

'wl-pop-before-smtp-server'
     The POP server name for POP-before-SMTP authentication.  If unset,
     'elmo-pop3-default-server' is used.

'wl-pop-before-smtp-authenticate-type'
     The POP authentication method for POP-before-SMTP authentication.
     If unset, 'elmo-pop3-default-authenticate-type' is used.

'wl-pop-before-smtp-port'
     The POP port number for POP-before-SMTP authentication.  If unset,
     'elmo-pop3-default-port' is used.

'wl-pop-before-smtp-stream-type'
     If 'ssl', POP connection is established using SSL. If 'starttls',
     STARTTLS (RFC2595) connection will be established.  If unset,
     'elmo-pop3-default-stream-type' is used.

   If variables for POP-before-SMTP ('wl-pop-before-smtp-*') are unset,
settings for POP folders ('elmo-pop3-default-*') are used.  Therefore,
if SMTP server and POP server are actually the same, and if POP folder
per default (such as '&') is available, no settings are required.

   Refer to the following URL about POP-before-SMTP.

     cursor).  If the region is active, cites the region (it affects
     only if 'transient-mark-mode' (on GNU Emacs) or 'zmacs-regions' (on
     XEmacs) is Non-nil).  If the command is called with prefix
     argument, the text inserted by yank command (the text content of
     clipboard) is cited.  ('wl-draft-yank-original')

     previewing MIME multi-part messages.  ('wl-draft-preview-message')

'C-c C-s'
     Sends the content of the current draft.  Does not erase the draft
     buffer.  This is useful for sending multiple messages, which are a
     little different from each other.  ('wl-draft-send')

'C-c C-c'
     Sends the content of the current draft and erases the draft buffer.
     ('wl-draft-send-and-exit')

     Save the current draft.  ('wl-draft-save')

'C-c C-k'
     Kills the current draft.  ('wl-draft-kill')

'C-x k'
     Kills the current draft.  ('wl-draft-mimic-kill-buffer')

'C-c C-z'
     Saves the current draft, and erases the draft buffer.  This is
     useful if you want to suspend editing of the draft.  You can resume
     editing by pressing 'E' ('wl-summary-reedit') in the '+draft'
     folder.  ('wl-draft-save-and-exit')

'C-c C-r'
     Encodes or decodes the specified region in Caesar cipher.

     ('wl-draft-highlight-and-recenter')

'M-t'
     Toggles off-line/on-line states of Wanderlust.
     ('wl-toggle-plugged')

'C-c C-o'
     Jumps to the other draft buffer, if exists.  With prefix argument,
     reads a file (if any) from the draft folder when there is no such
     buffer.  ('wl-jump-to-draft-buffer')

'C-c C-e'
     Applies 'wl-draft-config-alist'.  ('wl-draft-config-exec')

'C-c C-j'

7.3 Customizable Variables
==========================

'wl-subscribed-mailing-list'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  Mailing lists to which you
     subscribe.  If any of these are contained in 'To:' or 'Cc:' field
     of a reply draft, removes your own address from 'Mail-Followup-To:'
     and 'Cc:'.  And if any of these are contained in 'To:' or 'Cc:'
     field of a message to be automatically re-filed, the destination
     folder will be leaned in connection with the address.

     Example:

          (setq wl-subscribed-mailing-list
                '("wl@ml.gentei.org"
                  "apel-ja@m17n.org"
                  "emacs-mime-ja@m17n.org"))

'wl-insert-mail-followup-to'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  If non-nil, 'Mail-Followup-To:'
     field is automatically inserted in the draft buffer.

'wl-insert-mail-reply-to'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  If non-nil, 'Mail-Reply-To:' field
     is automatically inserted in the draft buffer.

'wl-auto-insert-x-face'
     The initial setting is 't'.  If non-nil and there is an encoded
     X-Face string in a file '~/.xface' (the value of the variable
     'wl-x-face-file'), inserts it as an 'X-Face:' field in the draft
     buffer.  If 'nil', it is not automatically inserted.

'wl-insert-message-id'
     The initial setting is 't'.  If non-nil, 'Message-ID:' field is
     automatically inserted on the transmission.

'wl-message-id-use-message-from'
     The initial setting is 't'.  If non-nil, the value of 'From:' field
     or 'wl-from' will be used as the domain part of 'Message-ID:'.

'wl-local-domain'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  If 'nil', the return value of the
     function 'system-name' will be used as the domain part of
     'Message-ID:'.

     If 'system-name' does not return FQDN (i.e.  the full name of the
     host, like 'smtp.gohome.org'), you *must* set this variable to the
     string of the local domain name without hostname (like
     'gohome.org').  That is, a concatenation of 'system-name' '.'
     'wl-local-domain' is used as domain part of the 'Message-ID:'.

     If your terminal does not have global IP, set the value of
     'wl-message-id-domain'.  (You might be beaten up on the Net News if
     you use invalid 'Message-ID:'.)

     Moreover, concatenation of 'system-name' '.'  'wl-local-domain'
     will be used as an argument to the HELO command in SMTP.

'wl-message-id-domain'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  If non-nil, this value is used as a
     domain part of the 'Message-ID:'.  If your terminal does not have
     global IP address, set unique string to this value (e.x.  your
     e-mail address).

'wl-unique-id-suffix'
     The initial setting is '.wl'.  You can specify the string in
     generated Message-ID which appear just before '@' or '%'.

'wl-draft-config-alist'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  Modifies the draft message just
     before the transmission.  The content of 'wl-draft-config-alist'
     will be automatically applied only once on the transmission.  If
     you want to apply it manually, use 'C-c C-e'.  This command can be
     used many times.

'wl-template-alist'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  This variable specifies the template
     to be applied in the draft buffer.

'wl-draft-config-matchone'

     (except for replying and forwarding).  'keep' is to use current
     window, 'full' is to use full frame window, 'split' is to split
     current window and use it.  If some function is specified, it is
     called with the draft buffer as an argument.

'wl-draft-reply-buffer-style'
     The initial setting is 'split'.  Style of draft buffer for replying
     and forwarding.  'keep' is to use message buffer window, 'full' is
     to use full frame window, 'split' is to split message buffer window
     and use it.  If some function is specified, it is called with the
     draft buffer as an argument.

'wl-draft-use-frame'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  If non-nil, use new frame for the
     draft.

'wl-draft-reply-default-position'

8 Off-line Management
*********************

Wanderlust has on-line and off-line states.

* Menu:

* Off-line State::              Wanderlust has on-line and off-line states
* Enable Operations::           Enable Disconnected Operations
* Plugged Mode::                Switching On-line/Off-line per Server/Port

* Variables of Plugged Mode::   Customize Plugged Mode


File: wl.info,  Node: Off-line State,  Next: Enable Operations,  Prev: Disconnected Operations,  Up: Disconnected Operations

8.1 Off-line State
==================

Wanderlust has on-line and off-line states.  In the off-line state, you
cannot access messages via network, unless they are cached.

   '[ON]' in the mode line indicates the on-line state.  '[--]' in the
mode line indicates the off-line state.  In folder or summary modes,
press 'M-t' to switch between off- and on-line.

   You can invoke Wanderlust in the off-line state by setting
'wl-plugged' to 'nil' in '~/.wl' or anything appropriate.

   In the off-line mode, 'n' and 'p' command in the summary mode ignores
uncached messages.


File: wl.info,  Node: Enable Operations,  Next: Plugged Mode,  Prev: Off-line State,  Up: Disconnected Operations

8.2 Enable Disconeected Operations
==================================

Even in the off-line state, provided that relevant messages are cached,
and the variable 'elmo-enable-disconnected-operation' (described later)
is non-nil, you can following operations: *Note Plugged Mode::, *Note
Off-line State settings::.

* Menu:

* Send Messages off-line::      Transmit Messages
* Re-file and Copy queue::      Re-file and Copy (IMAP4)
* Creation of Folders::         Create Folders off-line (IMAP4)
* Marking::                     Mark (IMAP4)
* Pre-fetching Reservations::   Pre-fetch

   As soon as Wanderlust becomes on-line, such operations invoked
off-line are reflected in the servers via network.

   If the variable 'elmo-enable-disconnected-operation' is 'nil', these
off-line operations are not executed and causes an error on re-file or
copy operations.


File: wl.info,  Node: Send Messages off-line,  Next: Re-file and Copy queue,  Prev: Enable Operations,  Up: Enable Operations

8.2.1 Transmission of Messages
------------------------------

You can proceed sending operation for mail/news messages while you are
off-line, then it will be reserved for sending (if you are using
'im-wl.el', it is irrelevant).  Messages reserved for sending while
off-line are accumulated in the queue folder, '+queue'.  These messages
are transmitted at once when Wanderlust becomes on-line.

   You can visit '+queue' in the off-line state and confirm content of
messages in the queue.  You can also remove messages.  Removed messages
are not transmitted even in the on-line state.


File: wl.info,  Node: Re-file and Copy queue,  Next: Creation of Folders,  Prev: Send Messages off-line,  Up: Enable Operations

8.2.2 Re-file and Copy (IMAP4)
------------------------------

Re-file and copy operations to IMAP folders invoked during the off-line
state are accumulated in the queue, and reflected in the server side
when Wanderlust becomes on-line.  If you visit destination folders after
off-line re-file or copy, it looks as if messages were appended even in
off-line state.

   For the safety reasons, messages re-filed off-line are removed from
source folders only if their 'Message-ID:' match messages on the
servers.  While the queue is processed, messages that failed to be
re-filed or copied to the specified folders are appended to the folder
'+lost+found'.


File: wl.info,  Node: Creation of Folders,  Next: Marking,  Prev: Re-file and Copy queue,  Up: Enable Operations

8.2.3 Creation of Folders (IMAP4)
---------------------------------

You can create IMAP folders off-line.  The creation of folders are
reflected in the servers when Wanderlust becomes on-line.  If the
creation of those folders fails at that time for some reasons, messages
to be re-filed into those are appended to the folder '+lost+found'
instead.


File: wl.info,  Node: Marking,  Next: Pre-fetching Reservations,  Prev: Creation of Folders,  Up: Enable Operations

8.2.4 Marking (IMAP4)
---------------------

Off-line changes in unread/read and importance mark '$' information are
also reflected in the servers when Wanderlust becomes on-line.


File: wl.info,  Node: Pre-fetching Reservations,  Prev: Marking,  Up: Enable Operations

8.2.5 Pre-fetching
------------------

You can make reservations for pre-fetching messages in networking
folders (IMAP, NNTP, POP3, shimbun).  Reserved messages are marked with
'u' but not cached yet.  When Wanderlust becomes on-line, they are
pre-fetched from servers.

8.3 Switching On-line/Off-line per Server/Port
==============================================

'M-t' described above switches networking states as a whole, but you can
switch on-line/off-line per server/port.

   Pressing 'C-t' in the folder or summary modes brings you in
wl-plugged-mode shown below, in which you can change the plugged state
for each port.

     Queuing:[ON] AutoFlushQueue:[--] DisconnectedOperation:[ON]
     [ON](wl-plugged)
       [--]hosta
         [--]smtp        +queue: 2 msgs (1,2)        ...sending queue
         [--]nntp(119)   +queue: 1 msg (3)           ...sending queue
       [ON]hostb
         [--]imap4/cram-md5(143) %#mh/wl(prefetch-msgs:3,mark-as-important:1)
                                 %inbox(delete-msgids:1)    ...dop queue
         [ON]nntp(119)
         [ON]smtp

   The first line indicates status of the following three variables, and
simply pressing '<SPC>' or '<RET>' in each labeled column modifies the
values of these variables.

     "Queuing"               wl-draft-enable-queuing
     "AutoFlushQueue"        wl-auto-flush-queue
     "DisconnectedOperation" elmo-enable-disconnected-operation

   where '[ON]' means its value is 't', and '[--]' means 'nil'.

   The second and after lines indicate on-line/off-line states of
servers and ports, where '[ON]' stands for on-line and '[--]' for
off-line (in XEmacs or Emacs 21, they are shown with icons).  Pressing
'<SPC>' or '<RET>' in each line switches its state.

   "sending queue" means messages accumulated in the folder '+queue' for
off-line transmission, and "dop queue" means off-line operations when
'elmo-enable-disconnected-operation' is 't'.

   They are displayed if there are any of them.  In the example above,
in the sending queue there are two messages (the first and the second in
the queue folder) for smtp to hosta and one (the third) for nntp to
hosta, and in the dop queue there are one for '%inbox' and two for
'%#mh/wl'.

   If you change '(wl-plugged)' in the second line, the variable
'wl-plugged' is changed, so that the mode line indicator and plugged
states of all ports are affected.  If you change plugged states of any
servers or ports, '(wl-plugged)' in the second line is affected
depending on 'elmo-plugged-condition' settings and the plugged state of
each port.

8.4 Invoking Wanderlust in the Off-line State
=============================================

As described before, if you set 'wl-plugged' to 'nil' in '~/.wl' or
anything appropriate, you can invoke Wanderlust in the off-line state.
You can specify off-line state on a per server or port basis.  Refer to
'wl-reset-plugged-alist' also.

   Usually, when Wanderlust starts up, the plugged state of each port is
read from '~/.folders' and 'wl-smtp-posting-server',
'wl-nntp-posting-server' and so on.  If you want to change the plugged
state of these ports or to add other ports, configure
'wl-make-plugged-hook' with a function.

     (add-hook 'wl-make-plugged-hook
               '(lambda ()
                  (elmo-set-plugged plugged-value(t/nil) server port)
                      ;; add or change plugged states of the port of the server
                  (elmo-set-plugged plugged-value(t/nil) server)
                      ;; if the port is omitted, all ports are affected
                      ;; (you cannot omit the port if you newly add the server)
                  ))

8.5 Customizable Variables
==========================

'wl-plugged'
     If this variable is set to 'nil', Wanderlust starts up in off-line
     mode from the beginning.

'wl-queue-folder'
     The initial setting is '+queue'.  This is the folder in which
     messages in the transmission queue are accumulated.

'wl-auto-flush-queue'
     The initial setting is 't'.  This flag controls automatic
     transmission of the queue when Wanderlust becomes on-line.  If
     non-nil, the queue is automatically transmitted (with confirmation
     by 'y-or-n-p').  If you want to transmit it manually, press 'F' in
     the folder mode.

'elmo-enable-disconnected-operation'
     The initial setting is 't'.  Controls off-line operations regarding
     networking folders.  If non-nil, off-line operations are carried
     out.

'elmo-lost+found-folder'
     The initial setting is '+lost+found'.  This is the folder to which
     messages are saved when they fails to be appended while the
     off-line re-file/copy queue is processed.

'elmo-plugged-condition'
     The initial setting is 'one'.  The value of 'wl-plugged' reflects
     the return value of the function 'elmo-plugged-p' (without
     arguments).  This variable 'elmo-plugged-condition' specifies the
     condition on which the return value of '(elmo-plugged-p)' should be
     t depending on the plugged state of each port.

          'one         : plugged if one or more ports are plugged.
          'all         : plugged if all ports are plugged.
          'independent : reflects wl-plugged (elmo-plugged) regardless of plugged
                         states of the ports.
          FUNCTION     : reflects the return value of the FUNCTION
           functions available per default
           'elmo-plug-on-by-servers
                       : reflects the plugged state of the servers specified by the
                         variable elmo-plug-on-servers.
           'elmo-plug-on-by-exclude-servers
                       : reflects the plugged state of the servers that are not
                         in elmo-plug-on-exclude-servers.
                            elmo-plug-on-exclude-servers defaults to
                             '("localhost"
                               (system-name)
                               (system-name)without the domain part)

          Example 1:
           (setq elmo-plugged-condition 'all)
          Example 2:
           (setq elmo-plug-on-servers '("smtpserver" "newsserver"))
           (setq elmo-plugged-condition 'elmo-plug-on-by-servers)
          Example 3:
           (setq elmo-plug-on-exclude-servers '("localhost" "myname"))
           (setq elmo-plugged-condition 'elmo-plug-on-by-exclude-servers)

'wl-reset-plugged-alist'
     The initial setting is 't'.  If non-nil, plugged states are
     initialized on a per server or port basis when Wanderlust starts
     up.

     If 'nil', plugged states are retained while Emacs is running.  In
     other words, they are initialized when Emacs is restarted even if
     the value is 'nil'.

File: wl.info,  Node: Expire,  Next: Archive,  Prev: Expire and Archive,  Up: Expire and Archive

9.1 Expiration
==============

Expiration means deletion of old messages which have outlasted a certain
period of time.

   'wl-expire' supports not only simple deletion, but also moving to
specified archiving folders.

9.2 How to Use
==============

Configure 'wl-expire-alist' and press 'e' in the folder mode, or 'M-e'
in the summary mode.

9.2.1 Configuring 'wl-expire-alist'
-----------------------------------

An example configuration of 'wl-expire-alist' is shown below.
Everything in this 'wl-expire-alist' makes a great difference in
expiration, so be careful.  I advise you to set 'wl-expire-use-log' to
't', especially in the initial stage.

     (setq wl-expire-alist
           '(("^\\+trash$"   (date 14) remove)
                                       ;; delete
             ("^\\+tmp$"     (date 7) trash)
                                       ;; re-file to 'wl-trash-folder'
             ("^\\+outbox$"  (number 300) "$outbox;lha")
                                       ;; re-file to the specific folder
             ("^\\+ml/tmp$"  nil)
                                ;; do not expire
             ("^\\+ml/wl$"   (number 500 510) wl-expire-archive-number1 t)
                                ;; archive by message number (retaining numbers)
             ("^\\+ml/.*"    (number 300 310) wl-expire-archive-number2 t)
                                ;; archive by a fixed number (retaining numbers)
             ("^\\+diary$"   (date 30) wl-expire-archive-date)
                                ;; archive by year and month (numbers discarded)
             ))

   Items in the list has the format of:

     (REGEXP-FOR-FOLDERS SPECIFICATION-OF-MESSAGES-TO-BE-DELETED DESTINATION)

The folder is examined if it matches REGEXP-FOR-FOLDERS from the
beginning of the list.  If you invoke expiration on the folder that does
not match any of them, nothing will happen.  And if either the second or
the third element of the item is 'nil', expiration will not take place.

   You can use any one of the following for
SPECIFICATION-OF-MESSAGE-TO-BE-DELETED:

'(number N1 [N2])'
     deletes messages depending on the number of messages in the folder.

     N1 is the number of messages which should survive deletion, for
     example if its value is 500, the newest 500 messages survive and
     the rests are deleted.

     N2 is the number of messages in the folder on which expiration
     should take place, which defaults to N1 + 1.  For example if its
     value is 510, folders with 510 or more messages are expired.  If
     you configured automatic expiration, frequently used folders may
     expire every time it receive messages, and you may be annoyed with
     the long delay in reading mail.  In that case, you can set a wide
     margin between N2 and N1, so that expiration would not take place
     until a certain number of messages accumulate.

     Messages with marks in 'wl-summary-expire-reserve-marks' (marked
     with important/new/unread) are not deleted.  If
     'wl-expire-number-with-reserve-marks' is non-nil, the folder will
     expire so as to have 500 messages including such ones.  Otherwise,
     it will have 500 messages except such ones.

'(date D1)'
     deletes messages depending on the dates.

     Messages dated D1 or more days ago are deleted, for example if its
     value is seven, messages seven days old or more are deleted.  Note
     that the date is the one in the 'Date:' field of the message, not
     when the message entered the folder.

     Messages with no or invalid 'Date:' field does not expire; you
     might have to delete them by hand.

   You can use any one of the following in the place of DESTINATION:

'remove'
     deletes the messages instantly.

'hide'
     hide the messages from summary (messages are not deleted).

'trash'
     moves the messages to 'wl-trash-folder'.

STRING(folder)
     moves the messages to the folder specified with STRING.

     It would be useful for specifying an archiving folder, but because
     this does not move important messages, it might be better to use
     the standard functions described below.

FUNCTION
     invokes the specified FUNCTION.

     To the FUNCTION, three arguments are passed: a folder name, a list
     of messages to be deleted, and msgdb information of the summary.
     You can specify function-specific arguments after the name of the
     FUNCTION.  Note that the list contains messages with marks in
     'wl-summary-expire-reserve-marks', be careful in writing your own
     function.

     These are four standard functions; three of them move messages to
     an archive folder in the specified way.  This means old messages
     can be compressed and saved in a file, being deleted from the
     original folder.  The last one divides messages to some MH folders.

     'wl-expire-archive-number1'
          re-files to archiving folders corresponding to the message
          numbers of the messages being deleted.  For example, a message
          numbered 102 will be re-filed to 'wl-00100.zip', 390 to
          'wl-00300.zip', and so on.  If 'wl-expire-archive-files' is
          200, messages will be re-filed to 'wl-00000.zip',
          'wl-00200.zip', 'wl-00400.zip', ....

          The archiving folders to which messages are re-filed are
          determined by the name of the folder as follows (in this case,
          archiving folders are handled as if 'elmo-archive-treat-file'
          were non-nil).

          If the folder type is localdir:
               'ARCHIVEDIR/FOLDERNAME-xxxxx.zip'

               For example, '+ml/wl' corresponds to '$ml/wl;zip'
               ('~/Mail/ml/wl-00100.zip').

          The folder type is other than localdir:
               'ARCHIVEDIR/FOLDERTYPE/FOLDERNAME-xxxxx.zip'

               For example, '%#mh/ml/wl' corresponds to
               '$imap4/#mh/ml/wl;zip'
               ('~/Mail/imap4/#mh/ml/wl-00100.zip').

          As you can see, in the case of localdir, the folder type is
          not included in the path name, but otherwise it is included.
          And you can control the prefix to the archiving folder name by
          'wl-expire-archive-folder-prefix'.  Refer to
          'wl-expire-archive-folder-prefix' for details.

     'wl-expire-archive-number2'
          re-files every certain number of messages to archiving
          folders.

          This differs from 'wl-expire-archive-number1' in that this
          re-files to the folder up to the specified number regardless
          of message numbers.  The archiving folders to which messages
          are re-filed are determined in the same way as
          'wl-expire-archive-number1'.

     'wl-expire-archive-date'
          re-files messages depending on its date (year and month) to
          archive folders.

          For example, a message dated December 1998 is re-filed to
          '$folder-199812;zip'.  The name of the archiving folders
          except the date part are determined in the same way as
          'wl-expire-archive-number1'.

          You can set the first argument to these three standard
          functions to non-nil in 'wl-expire-alist' so as to retain
          message numbers in the folder.  For example, it can be
          specified just after the name of the function:

               ("^\\+ml/wl$" (number 300 310) wl-expire-archive-number1 t)

          If you omit the argument, consecutive numbers from 1 are
          assigned for each archiving folder.

     'wl-expire-localdir-date'
          divedes messages depending on its date (year and month) to MH
          folders e.g.  to '+ml/wl/1999_11/', '+ml/wl/1999_12/'.

9.2.2 Treatment for Important or Unread Messages
------------------------------------------------

If you specify any of 'remove', 'trash', a folder name, or a standard
function, messages with marks in 'wl-summary-expire-reserve-marks'
(which are called "reserved messages" thereafter) are retained.

   Per default, this variable include the important, new, and unread
marks, so that messages with these marks are not removed.  Note that you
cannot include the temporary mark (i.e.  temporary marks are removed
anyway), and be sure to process temporary marks before you invoke
expiration.

9.2.3 Auto Expiration
---------------------

The following setup invokes expiration when you move into the summary
mode.  There will be no confirmation, so make sure you made no mistake
in regexp and other settings before you set up this.

     (add-hook 'wl-summary-prepared-pre-hook 'wl-summary-expire)

   In the folder mode, you can invoke expiration per group as well as
per folder.  Therefore, if you specify 'Desktop' group, all folders
matching 'wl-expire-alist' expire.

9.3 Tips
========

9.3.1 Treating archive folders.
-------------------------------

To treat archive folders created by 'wl-expire-archive-number1' and so
on, you must set non-nil value to 'elmo-archive-treat-file'.

9.3.2 Confirming
----------------

If you are to use 'remove', try 'trash' at first and see messages move
to 'wl-trash-folder' as expected, then replace it with 'remove'.  It
would be dangerous to use 'remove' from the beginning.

   If you are to use 'wl-expire-archive-number1' and the like, try to
make a folder of the archiver type ('zip' or 'lha') and see if you can
append messages to it.  Even if settings in 'wl-expire-alist' and
'elmo-archive' are correct, messages would not be saved anywhere and
disappeared in case the archiver program fails.

   After you make sure you can archive to the folder correctly, you can
invoke expiration and utilize the log.

   If you set 'wl-expire-use-log' to 't', '~/.elmo/expired-log' should
contain the log, for example:

     delete  +ml/wl  (593 594 595 596 597 598 599)
     move    +ml/wl -> $ml/wl-00600;tgz;wl  (600 601 602)

   The first column indicates the operation, i.e.  'delete', 'copy', or
'move'.  The next is the name of the folder that expired.  In the case
of 'copy' and 'move', the destination folder is recorded after '->'.
The last is the list of message numbers that are actually deleted or
moved (in the case of 'copy' and 'move', the number is the one in the
source folder, rather than the destination folder).

9.3.3 Re-filing Reserved Messages
---------------------------------

The three standard functions copy reserved messages to the archive
folder, but do not delete them from the source folder.  Because reserved
messages and the like always remain, they are recorded in
'~/.elmo/expired-alist' so that they are not copied over and over again.
They are not recorded if copied by 'wl-summary-archive'.

   If you enabled logging, usually 'move' is recorded for re-filing, but
instead 'copy' and 'delete' are recorded separately if reserved messages
are involved.  This is because it actually copies messages including
reserved, then deletes ones except reserved in that case.

9.4 Customizable Variables
==========================

'wl-expire-alist'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  This variable specifies folders and
     methods to expire.  For details, refer to 'wl-expire-alist'
     settings above.

'wl-summary-expire-reserve-marks'
     The initial setting is the list below.

          (list wl-summary-flag-mark
                wl-summary-new-uncached-mark
                wl-summary-new-cached-mark
                wl-summary-unread-uncached-mark
                wl-summary-unread-cached-mark)

     Messages with these marks are retained in the folder, even after
     expiration.  Only permanent marks can be listed, not temporary
     marks.

     You can list marks one by one as in the default; you can use the
     following settings as well:

     'all'
          All messages with permanent marks are retained, i.e.
          'wl-summary-read-uncached-mark' is included in addition to the
          defaults.

     'none'
          All messages are handled as usual ones that are already read,
          no matter what marks they have; even important messages are
          deleted.

'wl-expire-archive-files'
     The initial setting is 100.  This variable specifies the number of
     messages to be retained in one archiving folder.

'wl-expire-number-with-reserve-marks'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  If non-nil, if expiring messages are
     specified by 'number', messages with
     'wl-summary-expire-reserve-marks' are also retained.

'wl-expire-archive-get-folder-function'
     The initial setting is 'wl-expire-archive-get-folder'.

     This variable specifies a function that returns the name of an
     archiving folder for standard functions in the place of
     DESTINATION.  You can use the following three variables for simple
     modification of folder names; if you want more complex settings,
     define your own function in this variable.

     'wl-expire-archive-get-folder' can be customized by these
     variables:
        * 'wl-expire-archive-folder-name-fmt'
        * 'wl-expire-archive-folder-type'
        * 'wl-expire-archive-folder-prefix'

'wl-expire-archive-folder-name-fmt'
     The initial setting is '%s-%%05d;%s'.  This is a 'format' string
     for archiving folders used in 'wl-expire-archive-number1' and
     'wl-expire-archive-number2'.  Note that you must specify the
     message number by '%%d', because it is parsed twice by 'format'.

     If you modify this, adjust 'wl-expire-archive-folder-num-regexp' as
     well.

'wl-expire-archive-date-folder-name-fmt'
     The initial setting is '%s-%%04d%%02d;%s'.  This is a 'format'
     string for archiving folders used in 'wl-expire-archive-date'.
     Note that you must specify the message number by '%%d', because it
     is parsed twice by 'format'.  There should be '%%d' twice, one for
     the year and the other for the month.

     If you modify this, adjust
     'wl-expire-archive-date-folder-num-regexp' as well.

'wl-expire-archive-folder-type'
     The initial setting is 'zip'.  This variable specifies an archiver
     type of the archiving folders.

'wl-expire-archive-folder-prefix'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  This variable specifies the prefix
     (directory structure) to archiving folders.  Exercise extreme
     caution in using this feature, as it has not been seriously tested.
     In the worst case, there is a fear of destructing archiving
     folders.

     'nil'
          There will be no prefix.

     'short'
          For example, '+ml/wl' will be prefixed by 'wl', resulting in
          '$ml/wl-00000;zip;wl'.

     't'
          For example, '+ml/wl' will be prefixed by prefix 'ml/wl',
          resulting in

          '$ml/wl-00000;zip;ml/wl'.

'wl-expire-archive-folder-num-regexp'
     The initial setting is '-\\([-0-9]+\\);'.  This variable specifies
     the regular expression to be used for getting message numbers from
     multiple archiving folders specified by 'elmo-list-folders'.  Set
     it in accordance with 'wl-expire-archive-folder-name-fmt'.

'wl-expire-archive-date-folder-num-regexp'
     The initial setting is '-\\([-0-9]+\\);'.  This is the regular
     expression to be used for getting message numbers from multiple
     archiving folders specified by 'elmo-list-folders'.  Set it in
     accordance with 'wl-expire-archive-date-folder-name-fmt'.

'wl-expire-delete-oldmsg-confirm'
     The initial setting is 't'.  If non-nil, messages older than the
     one with the largest number will be deleted with confirmation.  If
     'nil', they are deleted without confirmation.

     This feature is valid only if non-nil is specified as a argument to
     the standard functions so as to retain numbers.

'wl-expire-use-log'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  If non-nil, expiration logs are
     recorded in '~/.elmo/expired-log'.  They are appended but not
     truncated or rotated automatically; you might need to remove it
     manually.

'wl-expire-add-seen-list'
     The initial setting is 't'.

     If non-nil, when messages are re-filed by expiration, read/unread
     information is passed to the destination folder.

     However if you do not read the destination folder from Wanderlust,
     'seen' under '~/.elmo/' grows larger and larger, so you might want
     to set this to 'nil' if you are simply saving to some archiving
     folders.  Even if its value is 'nil', messages in the archiving
     folders are simply treated as unread; it does not affect expiration
     itself.

'wl-expire-folder-update-msgdb'
     The initial setting is 't'.  If 't', in the folder mode, expiration
     is carried out after updating summary information.  If you
     specified a list of regular expressions of folder names, summary
     information is updated for matching folders only.

9.5 Archiving Messages
======================

9.5.1 Archiving Messages
------------------------

'M-x wl-summary-archive' copies the whole folder to archiving folders.
If there are the archiving folders already, only new messages are
appended.

   You can use 'wl-archive-alist' in order to specify how messages are
archived according to their folder names, as in 'wl-expire-alist'.  For
example:

     (setq wl-archive-alist
           '(("^\\+tmp$"     wl-archive-date)
             ("^\\+outbox$"  wl-archive-number2)
             (".*"           wl-archive-number1)))

   Each item in the list has the following format:

     (FOLDERS-REGEXP  DELETING-FUNCTION)

   As you can see, you can only use a function after FOLDERS-REGEXP.
Per default, there are three functions:

   * 'wl-archive-number1'
   * 'wl-archive-number2'
   * 'wl-archive-date'

   As inferred from their names, they work similarly to "expire"
versions, other than the following points:

   - No messages are deleted
   - Message numbers are retained even if invoked without arguments

   These functions are good to archive all messages in a folder by their
numbers or by their dates.  These are also useful for backup or
confirmation purposes before expiration.  If you try to re-file them
after they are archived, they are deleted but not re-filed.

   Per default, the archiving folders to which messages are copied are
determined automatically by 'wl-expire-archive-get-folder-function'.
You can copy to a specific folder by invoking with a prefix argument,
i.e.  'C-u M-x wl-summary-archive'.

   Note that this feature has not been seriously tested, because you can
simply copy to an archiving folder, for example by
'wl-summary-copy-region'.

   The archiving folders are determined by the same logic as in
'wl-summary-expire'; the following customizable variables are relevant:

   * 'wl-expire-archive-files'
   * 'wl-expire-archive-get-folder-function'
   * 'wl-expire-archive-folder-name-fmt'
   * 'wl-expire-archive-folder-type'
   * 'wl-expire-archive-folder-prefix'
   * 'wl-expire-archive-folder-num-regexp'

9.5.2 Customizable Variables
----------------------------

'wl-archive-alist'
     The initial setting is the list shown below:

          ((".*" wl-archive-number1))

     This variable specifies a function that copies to archiving
     folders.  To the function, three arguments are passed: a folder
     name, a list of messages in the folder, and msgdb information of
     the summary.  Needless to say, you can use your own function.

10 Score of the Messages
************************

Scoring is the function that associates a score (value) with each
message, and marks as read or deletes from the summary according to it.

   You can put target or important marks on essential messages, or read
marks on the ones you do not want to read, for example spam articles.

   This scoring function has a capability and a format similar to the
one that Gnus has, although there are some unsupported features and
Wanderlust specifics.  *Note (gnus)Scoring::.

* Score File Format::          Score File Format


File: wl.info,  Node: Score Commands,  Next: Score File Format,  Prev: Scoring,  Up: Scoring

10.1 Score Commands
===================

10.1.1 Score File Specification
-------------------------------

'wl-score-folder-alist' specifies score files or variables in which
scores are defined, corresponding to folder names.

     (setq wl-score-folder-alist
           '(("^-.*"
              "news.SCORE"
              "my.SCORE")
             (".*"
              "all.SCORE")))

   If paths to the score files are omitted, the directory specified in
the variable 'wl-score-files-directory' is assumed.

   No matter what you write in 'wl-score-folder-alist', the default
score file 'wl-score-default-file' ('all.SCORE') is always read (it does
not have to exist).  Therefore, in the example above, the three score
files, 'news.SCORE', 'my.SCORE', and 'all.SCORE' are read for the
folders that matches '^-.*'.

10.1.2 Scored Messages
----------------------

Scores are attached to the messages that are specified by
'wl-summary-score-marks' temporarily when the summary is updated; when
you exit from the summary, the scores are removed and reverts to the
defaults.

10.1.3 Creation of Score Files
------------------------------

In the summary buffer, move to an appropriate message and type 'L'.
Then type 's', 's', and 'p' at a prompt in a mini-buffer.  The string in
Subject is presented.  Edit it and press '<RET>'.

   This makes -1000 are scored for messages with the same 'Subject:' as
the string you entered.  That is, such a score file is created
automatically.

   Then, try typing 'h' and 'e' in the same summary buffer.  The score
file you just made appears.  This buffer is called "score editing
buffer" thereafter.  When you type 'C-c C-e' in it, you are prompted in
the mini-buffer as you are previously; type 'a'.  Then a score entry for
"From" should be inserted.  In this way, you can create a score file
easily either in the summary buffer or in the score editing buffer.

   By the way, you might be aware the numbers of key strokes are
different between 's s p' and 'a'.  This is determined by
'wl-score-header-default-entry'.  This variable specifies the default
score entries corresponding to header fields.  For example, for
"subject" field, a type and a time limit are prompted, but for "from"
field, they are fixed upon automatically as substring and permanent
respectively.  However, score values can be modified by the prefix
argument.  Typing '?' at the mini-buffer shows a help on keys and
corresponding headers and types.

   At last, type 'C-c C-c' in the score editing buffer.  This saves the
score file and terminates the edit mode.  Typing 'C-c C-c' after erasing
contents of the buffer deletes the score file being edited.

10.1.4 Tips
-----------

10.1.4.1 Selecting Score Files
..............................

You can change score files to which scores are appended by
'wl-summary-increase-score' and 'wl-summary-lower-score' by
'wl-score-change-score-file'.

10.1.4.2 Summing Up the Score
.............................

If you add the same entries by 'wl-summary-increase-score',
'wl-summary-lower-score', and 'wl-score-edit-insert-entry', scores for
the entry is summed up.

   For example, if you create 'from' entry with the score of -1000 by 'L
a' and again 'from' with -200, one entry with the score of -1200 will be
created as a result.

10.1.4.3 Creating Thread Key
............................

Creating 'Thread' key by 'wl-summary-increase-score' or
'wl-summary-lower-score' appends 'Message-ID' of all children.

10.1.4.4 Creating Followup Key
..............................

Creating 'Followup' key by 'wl-summary-increase-score' or
'wl-summary-lower-score' appends 'Message-ID' of the message at the
cursor to 'References' key.  If 'wl-score-auto-make-followup-entry' is
non-nil, 'Message-ID' of all messages to be followed up within dates
specified by 'wl-score-expiry-days'.

10.1.5 Key Bindings
-------------------

'K'
     Increases the score for the current message.  And the score entry
     is appended to the score file at the same moment.  You can specify
     the score value by a prefix argument.

'L'
     Decreases the score for the current message.  And the score entry
     is appended to the score file at the same moment.  You can specify
     the score value by a prefix argument.

'h R'
     Re-applies the scoring.  However, already scored messages are not
     scored anew.

'h c'
     Changes the score file currently selected.

'h e'
     Edits the score file currently selected.  If there are multiple
     score files, the previously specified one is selected.

'h f'
     Edits an arbitrary score file and selects it.

'h F'
     Erases caches associated to the score files that are read.  If you
     modified score files directly (from other than Wanderlust), you
     need to re-read them after erasing the cache.

'h m'
     Specifies the criterion for scores to be marked as read.  Messages
     with scores less than this value are marked as read.

'h x'
     Specifies the criterion for scores to be deleted from the summary.
     Messages with scores less than this value are deleted.  "Deleted"
     means it is not shown; they are not removed from the summary
     information or the folder.  The deleted messages can be shown by
     rescan-noscore again.

10.1.6 Key Bindings in the Score Editing Buffer
-----------------------------------------------

'C-c C-k'
     Abandons the file being edited.

'C-c C-c'
     Saves the file being edited, and quits from the edit mode.

'C-c C-p'
     Re-draws the score.

'C-c C-d'
     Inserts the number of dates from Dec.  31, 1 B.C. It is used for
     creating the third factor of time-limited scores.

'C-c C-s'
     Inserts the header of the message selected in the summary buffer.

'C-c C-e'
     Inserts the score entry of the message selected in the summary
     buffer.

10.1.7 Customizable Variables
-----------------------------

'wl-summary-default-score'
     The initial setting is 0 (zero).  This variable specifies the
     default value of the score.  The score is increased or decreased
     based upon this value.

'wl-summary-important-above'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  Messages with scores larger than
     this value are attached with the important mark ('$').  If 'nil',
     no important marks are attached.

'wl-summary-target-above'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  Messages with scores larger than
     this value are attached with the target mark ('*').  If 'nil', no
     target marks are attached.

'wl-summary-mark-below'
     The initial setting is 0 (zero).  Messages with scores smaller than
     this value are marked as read.

'wl-summary-expunge-below'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  Messages with scores smaller than
     this value are deleted from the summary.  If 'nil', they are not
     deleted.

'wl-summary-score-marks'
     The initial setting is the list shown below:

          (list wl-summary-new-uncached-mark
                wl-summary-new-cached-mark)

     Messages with these marks are scored.

'wl-use-scoring'
     The initial setting is t.  If non-nil, scoring is enabled.

'wl-score-files-directory'
     The initial setting is '~/.elmo/'.  The default directory for score
     files.

'wl-score-interactive-default-score'
     The initial setting is 1000.  This value is used as a score when a
     score factor is 'nil' in the score file.  It is also used in
     'wl-summary-increase-score' and 'wl-summary-lower-score', on
     condition that the value of 'wl-score-header-default-entry' is
     'nil'.

'wl-score-expiry-days'
     The initial setting is 7.  This is the number of days before
     time-limited scores are deleted.

'wl-score-update-entry-dates'
     The initial setting is 't'.  If non-nil, it enables deletion of
     time-limited scores.

'wl-score-header-default-entry'
     Specifies the default value for each header field for score entries
     created by 'wl-summary-increase-score', 'wl-summary-lower-score',
     and 'wl-score-edit-insert-entry'.

'wl-score-simplify-fuzzy-regexp'
     In the case of a type of a score entry is 'fuzzy', this specifies a
     regular expression to be deleted from the string.  Because this is
     usually used for Subject, the default is prefixes that are attached
     by mailing list programs.

'wl-summary-rescore-partial-threshold'
     The initial setting is 200.  When sync-all or rescan is executed,
     if there are messages more than this value, only the last same
     number of messages as this value are scored.

'wl-summary-auto-sync-marks'
     If non-nil, unread/important marks are synchronized when the
     summary does.  Unread marks reflect information on the IMAP4
     server.  Important marks reflect information on the IMAP4 server
     (flagged or not), and contents of ''flag' folder.  The initial
     setting is 't'.

10.2 Score File Format
======================

The format of score files are the same as Gnus, and basically you can
use Gnus score files as they are.  But they are not fully compatible
because some keys are not supported and there are Wanderlust specifics.
*Note (gnus)Score File Format::.

     (("subject"
       ("for sale" -1000 nil s)
       ("profit" -1000 nil s))
      ("from"
       ("spam@spamspamspam" -10000 nil s))
      ("followup"
       ("my@address" 3001 nil s))
      ("chars"
       (1000000 -10 nil >))
      (important 5000)
      (target 3000)
      (mark 0)
      (expunge -3000))

'string'
     If the key is a string, it is the name of the header to be matched.
     The following keys are available: 'Subject', 'From', 'Date',
     'Message-ID', 'References', 'To', 'Cc', 'Chars', 'Lines', 'Xref',
     'Extra', 'Followup', 'Thread' 'Chars' and 'Lines' mean the size and
     the number of lines of the message, respectively.  'Extra',
     'Followup', 'Thread' are described later.  The rest corresponds the
     field of the same name.

     Arbitrary numbers of core entries are specified after the key.
     Each score entry consists of these five factors:

       1. A factor that matches header.  This should be a number in the
          cases of 'lines' and 'chars', otherwise a string.

       2. A score factor.  When the first item matches, the score of the
          message is increased or decreased by this value.

       3. A time limiting factor.  If 'nil', the score is permanent, and
          in the case of a number, the score is deleted if it does not
          match for days ('wl-score-expiry-days') from the date
          specified by this.  The date is since Dec.  31, 1 B.C.

       4. A type factor.  This specifies the way the first factor
          matches.  Available types depend on keys.

          "From, Subject, References, Message-ID"
               For these keys in string, 'r' and 'R' (regexp), 's' and
               'S' (substring), 'e' and 'E' (exact match), as well as
               'f' and 'F' (fuzzy) can be used.  'R', 'S', 'E', and 'F'
               are case sensitive.

          "Lines, Chars"
               For these keys, the following five numerical relative
               operators can be used: '<', '>', '=', '>=', '<='.

          "Followup"
               This key matches 'From' header, and scores all follow-ups
               to the message.  For example, it would be useful for
               increasing scores for follow-ups to you own article.

               You can use the same types as 'From' except for 'f'.  And
               a 'Followup' entry is automatically appended to the score
               file.

          "Thread"
               This key scores (sub-)threads beginning with 'Message-ID'
               X.  A 'Thread' entry is automatically appended for each
               article that has X in the 'References' header.  You can
               make sure the whole thread including messages that does
               not have all ancestors 'Message-ID' in 'References' is
               scored.

               You can use the same types as 'References' except for
               'f'.  And a 'Thread' entry is automatically appended to
               the score file.

       5. A factor for extension header.  This is meaningful only if the
          key is 'Extra'.  This specifies headers to be matched other
          than standard headers like 'Subject' and 'From'.  Note that
          you should specify the header in 'elmo-msgdb-extra-fields'
          also.  Therefore it does not work in folders where extension
          headers cannot be retrieved.

     The sum of these scores _after all factors are applied_ becomes the
     score of the message.

'mark'
     Messages with a score less than this value is marked as read.  The
     default is 'wl-summary-mark-below'.

'expunge'
     Messages with a score less than this value is deleted from the
     summary.  The default is 'wl-summary-expunge-below'.

'mark-and-expunge'
     Both 'mark' and 'expunge' are applied, i.e.  messages with a score
     less than this value is marked as read and deleted from the
     summary.

'target'
     Messages with a score greater than this value is attached with temp
     marks.  The default is 'wl-summary-target-above'.

'important'
     Messages with a score greater than this value is attached with
     important marks.  The default is 'wl-summary-important-above'.

10.2.1 Caveats
--------------

Not to mention the 'extra' key, if 'lines' or 'xref' keys are used, you
need to set 'elmo-msgdb-extra-fields'.

     (setq elmo-msgdb-extra-fields '("lines" "xref"))

   There are other restrictions as shown below:

   * Because 'References' field in the summary information contains only
     the last 'Message-ID', 'references' key matches the last one only.

   Keys that can be seen by folder of types:

                             chars lines xref  extra
     localdir,localnews        Y     E     E     E
     nntp (supporting xover)   Y     E     E     N
          (otherwise)          N     E     E     E
     imap4                     Y     E     E     E
     pop3                      N     E     E     E

                     Y: can be seen
                     N: cannot be seen (ignored)
                     E: can be seen with elmo-msgdb-extra-fields settings

11 Address Book
***************

With address book, you can utilize address completion, and you have
summary displayed with nicknames.

* Menu:

* Mail Addresses::   Definition of Address Book
* Address Manager::  Address Manager


File: wl.info,  Node: Mail Addresses,  Next: Address Manager,  Prev: Address Book,  Up: Address Book

11.1 Address book
=================

The file '~/.addresses' is a simple address book for Wanderlust.  Make
address file '~/.addresses', and edit to suit your requirement.

   The data written in '~/.addresses' are used for address completion
under draft editing mode.  Furthermore, they are used when showing names
in summary display mode.  You can safely skip this section, if you don't
want to customize address completion and summary display.  It is
possible to add/change/remove addresses from '~/.addresses' in summary
buffer after Wanderlust is invoked.

   The format is very simple.  Like this.

     #
     # Lines begin with '#' are comment.
     # Empty lines are ignored
     #
     # Format of each line:
     # EMAIL-ADDRESS  "NICKNAME "REALNAME"
     #
     teranisi@gohome.org            "Yuuichi"      "Yuuichi Teranishi"
     foo@bar.gohome.org             "Mr. Foo"    "John Foo"
     bar@foo.gohome.org             "Mr. Bar"    "Michael Bar"

One line defines one persons description.

   Actually, in default setup, NICKNAME is used in summary-mode and
REALNAME is used in draft preparation mode.  This behavior is better
understood if you try it and confirmed the function first.  You can
write and try a small definition, so you will know the idea of the
address book before writing a big one.

   And, if MH alias file is specified in variable 'wl-alias-file', it is
used as an address information in the draft preparation mode.

   If variable 'wl-use-ldap' is non-nil (initial setting is 'nil'),
address completion in draft mode uses LDAP information.

   If you use LDAP, you have to set 'wl-ldap-server', 'wl-ldap-port' and
'wl-ldap-base' properly.  If your emacs does not have LDAP feature as
built-in feature (Currently only XEmacs can have built-in LDAP feature),
you have to set command exec 'PATH' to the program 'ldapsearch'.

11.2 Address Manager
====================

You can type 'C-c C-a' to enter address manger mode.  you can edit the
address book and insert address to draft buffer.

12 Spam Filter
**************

'wl-spam' provides an frontend to external spam filtering programs.  You
can register to or judge spam by the filtering program cooperateing with
messages operations on Wanderlust.

* Menu:

* Usage of Spam Filter::        Usage of Spam Filter
* Spam Filter Processors::      Supported spam filters


File: wl.info,  Node: Usage of Spam Filter,  Next: Spam Filter Processors,  Prev: Spam Filter,  Up: Spam Filter

12.1 Usage of Spam Filter
=========================

12.1.1 Initial Setting
----------------------

To use 'wl-spam', write in '~/.wl' as follows:

     ;; Use 'bogofilter' as spam back end
     ;; Set 'scheme' here as the spam filter you will use.
     ;; *Note Spam Filter Processors::.
     (setq elmo-spam-scheme 'bogofilter)
     (require 'wl-spam)

12.1.2 spam mark
----------------

The spam mark ('s') will be provided as new temporary mark.  Messages
marked by this will be refiled into 'wl-spam-folder' when the action is
called for execution.  Marked messages will be skipped by summary
walking in ordinary way.

   The spam mark is be put on by spam judgement described later, or by
invoking 'k m' at any time.

12.1.3 spam judgment
--------------------

You can judge spam messages by following ways:

  1. Make judgement on execution of auto-refile.

     Insert 'wl-refile-guess-by-spam' to arbitrary position in
     'wl-auto-refile-guess-functions' as follows.

          (setq wl-auto-refile-guess-functions
                '(wl-refile-guess-by-rule
                  wl-refile-guess-by-spam))

     In this example, judge spam if it could not decide refile
     destination by 'wl-refile-rule-alist'.

  2. Make judgement on entering the summary of specified folder.

     Specify the value of 'wl-spam-auto-check-folder-regexp-list' as the
     list of regular expressions for folder names to be automatically
     judged by spam filter.

          (setq wl-spam-auto-check-folder-regexp-list '("\\+inbox"))

     In this example, judgement will be processed when you enter summary
     of the folder whose name contains '+inbox'.

  3. Make judgement on splitting messages with 'elmo-split'.

     It provides new function 'spam-p' to be specified as 'CONDITION' in
     'elmo-split-rule'.  This function returns true when the message is
     judged as spam.  *Note Split messages::.

     You can also process learning by the result of judgement.  (You
     would better turn on this feature after learning to some extent)

     Example follows:

          (setq elmo-split-rule
                '(((spam-p) "+spam")
                  ;; to learn by the judgement, use following instead
                  ;((spam-p :register t) "+spam")
                  (t "+inbox"))

12.1.4 spam learning
--------------------

'wl-spam' automatically learn spam with refiling messages.

   At first, 'wl-spam' classifies the folders controlled by Wanderlust
into following 4 domains by the class of containig messages

'spam'
     Folders containing messages judged as spam.  (The folder specified
     by 'wl-spam-folder')
'good'
     Folders containing messages judged as non-spam.
'undecide'
     Folders containing messages not yet judged.  Folders without
     pre-distribution may belong to this domain e.g.  '+inbox'.
     (specified by 'wl-spam-undecided-folder-regexp-list')
'ignored'
     Foldes have nothing to do with spam processing e.g.
     'wl-trash-folder' or 'wl-draft-folder'.  (specified by
     'wl-spam-ignored-folder-regexp-list')

   When you refile messages across different domains, it automatically
learn messages as 'spam' or 'non-spam' according to domains it belongs
before and after.

   To put it concretely, it will learn by following rule:

'undecide -> spam'
     learn as spam.
'good -> spam'
     learn as spam and cancel previous study as non-spam.
'undecide -> good'
     learn as non-spam.
'spam -> good'
     learn as non-spam and cancel previous study as spam.

   It do not learn anything in other cases.

     The initial setting is 't'.  If non-nil, bodies of drafts and
     messages are also highlighted.

'wl-highlight-message-header-alist'
     When highlighting headers of drafts and messages, this variable
     specifies which faces are allocated to important
     ('wl-highlight-message-important-header-contents'), secondly
     important ('wl-highlight-message-important-header-contents2'), and
     unimportant ('wl-highlight-message-unimportant-header-contents')
     message headers.  Similarly, it can be used for allocating
     arbitrary faces to arbitrary regular expressions.

'wl-highlight-citation-prefix-regexp'
     Specifies a regular expression to which quoted lines in bodies of
     drafts and messages match.  Bodies matching to this regular
     expression are highlighted by the faces specified by
     ('wl-highlight-message-cited-text-*').

'wl-highlight-highlight-citation-too'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  If non-nil, the quoting regular
     expression itself given by 'wl-highlight-citation-prefix-regexp' is
     also highlighted.

'wl-highlight-citation-header-regexp'
     Specifies a regular expression that denotes beginning of quotation.
     Bodies matching to this regular expression are highlighted by the
     face specified by 'wl-highlight-message-headers'.

'wl-highlight-max-header-size'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  If a header size is larger than this
     value, it will not be highlighted.  If 'nil', always highlighted
     (ignore header size).

'wl-highlight-max-message-size'
     The initial setting is 10000.  If a message is larger than this
     value, it will not be highlighted.  With this variable, highlight
     is suppressed for uuencode or huge digest messages.

'wl-highlight-signature-separator'
     Specifies regular expressions that denotes the boundary of a
     signature.  It can be a regular expression, or a list of ones.
     Messages after the place that matches this regular expression are
     highlighted by the face specified by
     'wl-highlight-message-signature'.

'wl-max-signature-size'
     The initial setting is 400.  This is the largest size for a
     signature to be highlighted.

'wl-use-highlight-mouse-line'
     The initial setting is 't'.  If non-nil, the line pointed by the
     mouse is highlighted in the folder mode, summary mode, and the
     like.

13.2.2 Setting Colors and Fonts of the Characters
-------------------------------------------------

If you want to change colors or fonts of the characters, you need to
modify faces defined in Wanderlust.  Use 'set-face-font' if you want to
change fonts, and 'set-face-foreground' for colors, and so on.  You
cannot write face settings in '.emacs'; write in '~/.wl'.

   For example, if you want to change the color for signatures to
yellow, write

     (set-face-foreground 'wl-highlight-message-signature "yellow")

in '~/.wl'.

13.3 Notify Mail arrival
========================

Following setting is to notify mail arrival of '%inbox' by the indicator
on the modeline

     (setq wl-biff-check-folder-list '("%inbox"))

13.3.1 Customizable Variables
-----------------------------

'wl-biff-check-folder-list'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  This is the list of folders to check
     mail arrival.  If 'nil', wl doesn't check mail arrival.

'wl-biff-check-interval'
     The initial setting is 40 (in seconds).  Check mail arrival in this
     period.

'wl-biff-use-idle-timer'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  If it is 'nil', check mail arrival
     when the time specified by 'wl-biff-check-interval' has passed.  If
     it is non-nil, check mail arrival when idling time exceeds
     'wl-biff-check-interval'.

'wl-biff-notify-hook'
     This hook is run at the arrival of new mail.  To beep with mail
     arrival(initial setting), set as follows.
          (setq wl-biff-notify-hook '(ding))
     For silence, set to 'nil'.

13.4 Manage Passwords
=====================

If you input passwords to connect servers, they are stored in the
variable 'elmo-passwd-alist' per connection.  You should be careful that
others might read your passwords if they can touch your Emacs, since
encoded plain passwords are there.

   If you invoke 'M-x elmo-passwd-alist-save' while you have stored
passwords, then they are saved on the file, and it will save you to
input passwords.  In this case, the risk that someone reads your
keystroke might decrease, but please not that plain passwords are stored
on a file.  You should treat them very carefully.  To remove saved
passwords on file, invoke 'M-x elmo-passwd-alist-clear' and then 'M-x
elmo-passwd-alist-save'.

'elmo-passwd-alist-file-name'
     The initial setting is 'passwd'.  This is the name of the file in
     which passwords are saved.  'elmo-passwd-alist-save' saves current
     passwords to the file.

'elmo-passwd-life-time'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  If the value is some number, timer
     is set to remove password entry after 'elmo-passwd-life-time'
     seconds since you input the password.  'nil' means never to remove
     passwords.

13.5 Message splitting
======================

You can use 'elmo-split' to split message in folder specified by the
variable 'elmo-split-folder' a la 'procmail' according to some specified
rules.  To use this feature, set as follows in your '~/.emacs' at first.

     (autoload 'elmo-split "elmo-split" "Split messages on the folder." t)

   Set source folder like following.

     (setq elmo-split-folder "%inbox")

   And specify the rule in the variable 'elmo-split-rule' (its format
will be is described below).  Then you can invoke 'M-x elmo-split' to
split messages according to 'elmo-split-rule'.  On the other hand,
invoke 'C-u M-x elmo-split' to do a rehearsal and show result (do not
split actually).

   We will describe how to specify the rule.  First of all, see
following example, please.

     (setq elmo-split-rule
           ;; Store messages from spammers into '+junk'
           '(((or (address-equal from "i.am@spammer")
     	     (address-equal from "dull-work@dull-boy")
     	     (address-equal from "death-march@software")
     	     (address-equal from "ares@aon.at")
     	     (address-equal from "get-money@richman"))
     	 "+junk")
     	;; Store messages from mule mailing list into '%mule'
     	((equal x-ml-name "mule") "%mule")
     	;; Store messages from wanderlust mailing list into '%wanderlust'
     	;; and continue evaluating following rules
     	((equal x-ml-name "wanderlust") "%wanderlust" continue)
     	;; Store messages from Yahoo user into '+yahoo-{username}'
     	((match from "\\(.*\\)@yahoo\\.com")
     	 "+yahoo-\\1")
     	;; Store unmatched mails into '+inbox'
     	(t "+inbox")))

   The basic unit of the rule is a combination like

     ('CONDITION' 'ACTION' [continue])

   If 'CONDITION' is true, 'ACTION' is performed.  The 1st element
'CONDITION' is a condition represented by a balanced expression (sexp).
Its grammar will be explained below.  The 2nd element 'ACTION' is the
name of the folder to split messages into, or a symbol.  When the 3rd
element 'continue' is specified as symbol, evaluating rules is not
stopped even when the condition is satisfied.

   The grammar for 'CONDITION' is as follows.  See example above to
learn how to write the condition practically.

  1. Functions which accept arguments 'FIELD-NAME' and 'VALUE'.
     ('FIELD-NAME' is a symbol that describes the field name)

     'equal'
          True if the field value equals to 'VALUE'.  Case of the
          letters are ignored.
     'match'
          True if the field value matches to VALUE. 'VALUE' can contain
          '\&' and '\N' which will substitute from matching '\(\)'
          patterns in the previous 'VALUE'.
     'address-equal'
          True if one of the addresses in the field equals to 'VALUE'.
          Case of the letters are ignored.
     'address-match'
          True if one of the addresses in the field matches to 'VALUE'.
          'VALUE' can contain '\&' and '\N' which will substitute from
          matching '\(\)' patterns in the previous 'VALUE'.

  2. Functions which accept an integer argument ('SIZE').

     '<'
          True if the size of the message is less than 'SIZE'.
     '>'
          True if the size of the message is greater than 'SIZE'.

  3. Functions which accept any number of arguments.

     'or'
          True if one of the argument returns true.
     'and'
          True if all of the arguments return true.

  4. A symbol.

     When a symbol is specified, it is evaluated.

   You can specify followings as 2nd 'ACTION'.

  1. folder name

     If some string is specified, it will be regarded as the destination
     folder, and the message will be appended to it.

  2. 'delete'

     If the symbol 'delete' is specified, delete the substance of the
     message in 'elmo-split-folder'

  3. 'noop'

     If the symbol 'noop' is specified, do nothing on the message and
     keep it as it is.

  4. function

     If some function is specified, execute it.

   If the message passes all rules, it will be dealed along 'ACTION'
specified by 'elmo-split-default-action'.

13.7.1 Draft for Replay
-----------------------

If you type 'a' in the Summary Buffer, a draft for reply is prepared.
The addressee for the draft is decided by following rules.

   For example, you can set as follows:

     (setq wl-draft-reply-without-argument-list
           '(("Mail-Followup-To" . (("Mail-Followup-To") nil ("Newsgroups")))
             ("Followup-To" . (nil nil ("Followup-To")))
             (("X-ML-Name" "Reply-To") . (("Reply-To") nil nil))
             ("From" . (("From") ("To" "Cc") ("Newsgroups")))))

   Where each element of the list 'wl-draft-reply-without-argument-list'
is in the form

     (key . (to-list cc-list newsgroup-list))

   and if the field designated by 'key' exist in the parent message,
parent's field values designated by 'to-list' are copied to 'To:' in the
draft.  Similarly, parent's fields designated by 'cc-list' and
'newsgroup-list' are copied to 'Cc:' and 'Newsgroups:' in the draft
respectively.

   Examples:

     ("Mail-Followup-To" . (("Mail-Followup-To") nil ("Newsgroups")))

   Match if the parent has 'Mail-Followup-To' field.  The components of
parent's 'Mail-Followup-To' and 'Newsgroups' fields are copied to 'To'
and 'Newsgroups' in the draft respectively.

     (("X-ML-Name" "Reply-To") . (("Reply-To") nil nil))

   Match if the parent has both 'X-ML-Name' and 'Reply-To' fields.
Parent's 'Reply-To' is copied to 'To' in the draft.

     ("From" . (("From") ("To" "Cc") ("Newsgroups")))

   Copy parent's 'From' to 'To' in the draft, parent's 'To' and 'Cc' to
'Cc', parent's 'Newsgroups' to 'Newsgroups' respectively.

   These are evaluated in order and first matched one is used.

   Moreover, the behavior of 'a' with prefix argument can be directed by
'wl-draft-reply-with-argument-list' as well.

   By the way, you can use some function (will be evaluated in the
parent message buffer) in the place of 'key' or 'to-list' etc.

   If you want to write a rule for replying to message written by
yourself, specify function 'wl-draft-self-reply-p' as 'key'.

   If you only want to reply to mailing lists in
'wl-subscribed-mailing-list' if the parent has some of them, set as
follows:

     (defun wl-mailing-list-addresses ()
       (let (list-addrs)
         (dolist (to (mapcar
     		 (lambda (addr)
     		   (nth 1 (std11-extract-address-components addr)))
     		 (wl-parse-addresses
     		  (wl-concat-list
     		   (elmo-multiple-fields-body-list (list "To" "Cc"))
     		   ","))))
           (when (elmo-string-matched-member to wl-subscribed-mailing-list t)
     	(setq list-addrs (cons to list-addrs))))
         (nreverse list-addrs)))

     (setq wl-draft-reply-with-argument-list
           '((wl-mailing-list-addresses . (wl-mailing-list-addresses nil nil))
     	("Reply-To" . (("Reply-To") nil nil))
     	("Mail-Reply-To" . (("Mail-Reply-To") nil nil))

13.8 Customizable Variables
===========================

Customizable variables that have not been described yet:

'wl-default-folder'
     The initial setting is '%inbox'.  This is the default value for
     moving to a folder and the like.

'wl-draft-folder'
     The initial setting is '+draft'.  It is the folder to which drafts
     are saved.  It must be a writable folder.  You can set IMAP remote
     folder, Maildir and so on.  Note that variable settings applied by
     'wl-draft-config-exec' is saved under 'elmo-msgdb-directory'.  That
     is to say, if you specified remote folder as 'wl-draft-folder',
     variable settings which are applied by 'wl-draft-config-exec'
     before saving the draft will not affect on the draft buffer on
     another host by invoking 'wl-summary-reedit'.

'wl-trash-folder'
     The initial setting is '+trash'.  It is the wastebasket folder.  If
     you changed this variable, you had better restart Wanderlust.

'wl-interactive-exit'
     The initial setting is 't'.  If non-nil, you are asked for
     confirmation when Wanderlust terminates.

'wl-interactive-send'
     The initial setting is 't'.  If non-nil, you are asked for
     confirmation when mail is sent.

'wl-default-sync-range'
     The initial setting is 'update'.  Default update range of the
     summary.  You can specify 'all', 'update', 'rescan' or 'no-sync'.
     See description of 'wl-summary-sync' for the meaning of ranges.

'wl-folder-sync-range-alist'
     The initial setting is the alist shown below:

          (("^&.*$" . "all")
           ("^\\+draft$\\|^\\+queue$" . "all"))

     This is an associative list of regular expressions of folder names
     and update range of the summary.  Update range is one of the 'all',
     'update', 'rescan' or 'no-sync'.  If the folder do not match any of
     them, the value of 'wl-default-sync-range' is used ('update' by
     default).  See description of 'wl-summary-sync' for the meaning of
     ranges.

'wl-ask-range'
     The initial setting is 't'.  If 'nil', the value of
     'wl-folder-sync-range-alist' is used for updating the summary when
     you changed folders.

'wl-mime-charset'
     The initial setting is 'x-ctext'.  This is the MIME charset for
     messages that are not MIME (e.g.  without 'Content-Type:').  This
     value also used as default charset for summary.  (If you want to
     share Summary on Nemacs and other Emacsen, set this value as
     'iso-2022-jp'.)

'wl-highlight-folder-with-icon'
     This is meaningful for XEmacs or Emacs 21..  The initial setting
     depends on Emacsen ('t' for XEmacs or Emacs 21 with icons).

'wl-strict-diff-folders'
     This is a list of regular expressions of folders.  Unread messages
     are checked, for example when you press 's' in the folder mode,
     usually in a brief way (rapidly processed but not accurate).  The
     folders matching this variable are seriously checked.  You may want
     to set this variable so as to match conditional filter folders for
     IMAP4 folders.  The initial setting is 'nil'.

'wl-folder-use-server-diff'
     When unread messages are checked, for example when you press 's' in
     the folder mode, usually (the number of messages on the server) -
     (the number of local messages) will be the number of unread
     messages.  However, if this variable is non-nil, the number of
     unread messages on the server is checked.  This affects IMAP4
     folders only, but IMAP4 folders in mail boxes matching
     'elmo-imap4-disuse-server-flag-mailbox-regexp' are not checked for
     the number of unread messages on the server, even if they matches
     this variable.  The initial setting is 't'.

'wl-auto-check-folder-name'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  You can specify a folder or a group
     which is checked for unread message at the start.  You can also
     specify a list of folders (groups) to be checked.  If the value is
     'nil', whole Desktop is checked at the start.  If it is 'none', no
     folders are checked.

'wl-auto-uncheck-folder-list'
     The initial setting is the list shown below:

          ("\\$.*")

     You can set a list of regular expressions to specify folders which
     are not automatically checked even if they are included in some
     groups assigned by 'wl-auto-check-folder-name'.

'wl-auto-check-folder-list'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  You can set a list of regular
     expressions to specify exceptions for
     'wl-auto-uncheck-folder-list'.

'wl-no-save-folder-list'
     The initial setting is the list shown below:

          ("^/.*$")

     This is a list of regular expressions of folders not to be saved.

'wl-save-folder-list'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  This is a list of regular
     expressions of folders to be saved.  This takes precedence over
     'wl-no-save-folder-list'.

'wl-folder-mime-charset-alist'
     The initial setting is the alist shown below:

          (("^-alt\\.chinese" . big5)
           ("^-relcom\\." . koi8-r)
           ("^-tw\\." . big5)
           ("^-han\\." . euc-kr))

     This is an associative list of regular expressions of folder names
     and MIME charsets.  If a folder do not match, 'wl-mime-charset' is
     used.

'wl-folder-init-load-access-folders'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  This is a list of access groups to
     be loaded specifically at the start.  If it is 'nil',
     'wl-folder-init-no-load-access-folders' is referred.

'wl-folder-init-no-load-access-folders'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  This is a list of access groups not
     to be loaded specifically at the start.  It is ignored if
     'wl-folder-init-load-access-folders' is non-nil.

'wl-dispose-folder-alist'
     The initial setting is the alist shown below:

          (("^-" . remove)
           ("^@" . remove))

     This list determines disposition of messages with disposal marks.
     Each item in the list is a folder and destination; you can specify
     any one of the following in the place of destination:

          remove or null : deletes the messages instantly.
          string             : moves the messages to the specific folder.
          trash or others  : moves the messages to wl-trash-folder.

'wl-x-face-file'
     The initial setting is '~/.xface'.  The name of the file that
     contains encoded X-Face strings.  *Note x-face-mule::.

'wl-demo-display-logo'
     If non-nil, bitmap image is shown on the opening demo.  If you set
     'xpm' or 'xbm', (if possible) display selected image type logo.

'elmo-use-database'
     This is meaningful for XEmacs only.  The initial setting depends on
     XEmacs ('t' for XEmacs with dbm).  If non-nil, Message-ID is
     controlled by dbm.

'elmo-nntp-list-folders-use-cache'
     The initial setting is 600 (in seconds).  This is period in seconds
     during which results of 'list' and 'list active' in NNTP are
     cached.  If it is 'nil', they are not cached.

'elmo-nntp-max-number-precedes-list-active'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  If non-nil, the number of article
     obtained by 'list active' in NNTP are used as the maximum article
     number of the folder.  Set this to 't' if you are using for example
     INN 2.3 as an NNTP server, and if the number of read messages is
     not correct.

'elmo-nntp-default-use-listgroup'
     The initial setting is 't'.  If non-nil, 'listgroup' is used for
     checking the total number of articles.  If it is 'nil', 'group' is
     used.  In the latter case, the processing will be a little faster
     at the sacrifice of accuracy.

'elmo-pop3-send-command-synchronously'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  If non-nil, POP3 commands are issued
     synchronously.  Some implementation of POP3 server fails to get
     summary information without this setting.  You may have to set this
     variable to 't', if the process hangs while looking up POP3.

'elmo-dop-flush-confirm'
     The initial setting is 't'.  If non-nil, you are asked for
     confirmation if accumulated off-line operations are executed.

'elmo-network-session-idle-timeout'
     The initial setting is 'nil'.  Idle timeout of the network cache.
     Specified in seconds.  If elapsed time since last access is larger
     than this value, cached session is not reused.  If nil, network
     cache is reused.

14 Switch from older version of Wanderlust
******************************************

This chapter explains the important thing for the upgrade, or migration
from the previous version.  It includes the changes of the setup,
limitations etc.

* Menu:

* Before 2.12.0::       From prior to the version 2.12.0


File: wl.info,  Node: Before 2.12.0,  Prev: Migration,  Up: Migration

14.1 Migration from prior to the version 2.12.0
===============================================

14.1.1 The conversion of msgdb
------------------------------

From version 2.12.0 on, the structure of msgdb is changed.  The msgdb
for newly created folder will use this new format when created and
saved.  But by writing following line, you may use the old format of the
msgdb as it was.

     (setq elmo-msgdb-default-type 'legacy)

   With the default setup, the old msgdb format is converted to the new
format automatically.  You may change this behavior by writing following
lines in '~/.wl'.

     ;; If the format of msgdb is different from elmo-msgdb-default-type,
     ;; the format will be converted automatically when
     ;; the msgdb is being loaded (default).
     (setq elmo-msgdb-convert-type 'auto)

     ;; Convert msgdb when hitting 's all' in Summary mode
     (setq elmo-msgdb-convert-type 'sync)

     ;; Inhibit conversion
     (setq elmo-msgdb-convert-type nil)

   As is explained in above section, you may continue to use the old
format.  But you will have following limitations.

  1. You cannot use forwarded mark ('F', 'f').
  2. You may only use 'important' flag.  The other global flags may not
     be available.

14.1.2 Changes from ''mark' folder to ''flag'.
----------------------------------------------

The folder ''mark' will be automatically converted to ''flag' folder
when you first start the new version of Wanderlust.  But there are some
restrictions on this type of migrated folder.

  1. 'important' flag attached will not be removed by deleting the
     associated message in ''flag' folder.

  2. The message won't be deleted by removing 'important' flag in
     ''flag' folder.

  3. help-echo will not show you the old message.

   If you have problem with migrating from ''mark' folder to the ''flag'
folder, invoking 'M-x elmo-global-mark-upgrade' will transfer the
message from ''mark' folder to the ''flag' folder.  The duplicated
message will not be processed, you may issue that command repeatedly.

17.2 The Name
=============

According to a dictionary, Wanderlust has the meaning:

     wanderlust
       n eager longing for or impulse towards travelling in distant lands
       [Ger, fr wandern to wander + lust desire, pleasure]

but I had no profound intention.  (if farfetched, IMAP => you can read
mail anywhere => desire to wander ?)

   Elmo is the abbreviation of 'Elisp Library for Message
Orchestration'.  At first I meant the red puppet in the Sesame Street,
but you may associate it with Wandering => Drifting => Guidepost => St.
Elmo's fire => elmo.

17.3 Code Names
===============

Each versions has code names (they are almost jokes).  Currently they
are picked up alphabetically from the top 40 hits of U.S. Billboard
magazines in 1980s.
