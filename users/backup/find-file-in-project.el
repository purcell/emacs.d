;;; Commentary:

;; This library provides a couple methods for quickly finding any file
;; in a given project.  It depends on GNU find.

;; A project is found by searching up the directory tree until a file
;; is found that matches `ffip-project-file'.  (".git" by default.)
;; You can set `ffip-project-root-function' to provide an alternate
;; function to search for the project root.  By default, it looks only
;; for files whose names match `ffip-patterns',

;; If you have so many files that it becomes unwieldy, you can set
;; `ffip-find-options' to a string which will be passed to the `find'
;; invocation in order to exclude irrelevant subdirectories.  For
;; instance, in a Ruby on Rails project, you may be interested in all
;; .rb files that don't exist in the "vendor" directory.  In that case
;; you could set `ffip-find-options' to "-not -regex \".*vendor.*\"".

;; All these variables may be overridden on a per-directory basis in
;; your .dir-locals.el.  See (info "(Emacs) Directory Variables") for
;; details.

;; Recommended binding: (global-set-key (kbd "C-x f") 'find-file-in-project)

;;; TODO:

;; Add compatibility with BSD find (PDI; I can't virtualize OS X)
