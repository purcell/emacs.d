;;; Commentary:

;; This file defines the "universal" submode class, the default value
;; of `mmm-global-classes', which specifies a standard way to indicate
;; that part of a buffer should be in a different mode--for example,
;; in an email message.

;;; Code:

(require 'mmm-auto)
(require 'mmm-vars)

(defun mmm-univ-get-mode (string)
  (string-match "[a-zA-Z-]+" string)
  (setq string (match-string 0 string))
  (let ((modestr (intern (if (string-match "mode\\'" string)
                             string
                           (concat string "-mode")))))
    (or (mmm-ensure-modename modestr)
        (signal 'mmm-no-matching-submode nil))))

(mmm-add-classes
 `((universal
    :front "{%\\([a-zA-Z-]+\\)%}"
    :back "{%/~1%}"
    :insert ((?/ universal "Submode: " @ "{%" str "%}" @ "\n" _ "\n"
                 @ "{%/" str "%}" @))
    :match-submode mmm-univ-get-mode
    :save-matches 1
    )))
