;;; Commentary:

;; This file contains functions and hooks to load and enable MMM Mode
;; automatically. It sets up autoloads for the main MMM Mode functions
;; and interactive commands, and also sets up MMM Global Mode.

;;{{{ Comments on MMM Global Mode

;; This is a kludge borrowed from `global-font-lock-mode'.  The idea
;; is the same: we have a function (here `mmm-mode-on-maybe') that we
;; want to be run whenever a major mode starts.  Unfortunately, there
;; is no hook (like, say `major-mode-hook') that all major modes run
;; when they are finished.  `post-command-hook', however, is run after
;; *every* command, so we do our work in there.  (Actually, using
;; `post-command-hook' is even better than being run by major mode
;; functions, since it is run after all local variables and text are
;; loaded, which may not be true in certain cases for the other.)

;; In order to do this magic, we rely on the fact that there *is* a
;; hook that all major modes run when *beginning* their work. They
;; call `kill-all-local-variables' (unless they are broken), which in
;; turn runs `change-major-mode-hook'.  So we add a function to *that*
;; hook which saves the current buffer and temporarily adds a function
;; to `post-command-hook' which processes that buffer.

;; Actually, in the interests of generality, what that function does
;; is run the hook `mmm-major-mode-hook'. Our desired function
;; `mmm-mode-on-maybe' is then added to that hook. This way, if the
;; user wants to run something else on every major mode, they can just
;; add it to `mmm-major-mode-hook' and take advantage of this hack.
