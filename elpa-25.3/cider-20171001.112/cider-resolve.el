;;; Commentary:

;; The ns cache is a dict of namespaces stored in the connection buffer.  This
;; file offers functions to easily get information about variables from this
;; cache, given the variable's name and the file's namespace.  This
;; functionality is similar to that offered by the `cider-var-info' function
;; (and others).  The difference is that all functions in this file operate
;; without contacting the server (they still rely on an active connection
;; buffer, but no messages are actually exchanged).

;; For this reason, the functions here are well suited for very
;; performance-sentitive operations, such as font-locking or
;; indentation.  Meanwhile, operations like code-jumping are better off
;; communicating with the middleware, just in the off chance that the cache is
;; outdated.

;; Below is a typical entry on this cache dict.  Note that clojure.core symbols
;; are excluded from the refers to save space.
