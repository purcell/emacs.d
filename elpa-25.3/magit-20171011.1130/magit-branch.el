;;; Commentary:

;; This library implements support for branches.  It defines popups
;; and commands for creating, checking out, manipulating, and
;; configuring branches.  Commands defined here are mainly concerned
;; with branches as pointers, commands that deal with what a branch
;; points at, are defined elsewhere.

  "Whether to favor remote upstreams when creating new branches.

When a new branch is created, then the branch, commit, or stash
at point is suggested as the default starting point of the new
branch, or if there is no such revision at point the current
branch.  In either case the user may choose another starting
point.

If the chosen starting point is a branch, then it may also be set
as the upstream of the new branch, depending on the value of the
Git variable `branch.autoSetupMerge'.  By default this is done
for remote branches, but not for local branches.

You might prefer to always use some remote branch as upstream.
If the chosen starting point is (1) a local branch, (2) whose
name matches a member of the value of this option, (3) the
upstream of that local branch is a remote branch with the same
name, and (4) that remote branch can be fast-forwarded to the
local branch, then the chosen branch is used as starting point,
but its own upstream is used as the upstream of the new branch.

Members of this option's value are treated as branch names that
have to match exactly unless they contain a character that makes
them invalid as a branch name.  Recommended characters to use
to trigger interpretation as a regexp are \"*\" and \"^\".  Some
other characters which you might expect to be invalid, actually
are not, e.g. \".+$\" are all perfectly valid.  More precisely,
if `git check-ref-format --branch STRING' exits with a non-zero
status, then treat STRING as a regexp.

Assuming the chosen branch matches these conditions you would end
up with with e.g.:

  feature --upstream--> origin/master

instead of

  feature --upstream--> master --upstream--> origin/master

Which you prefer is a matter of personal preference.  If you do
prefer the former, then you should add branches such as \"master\",
\"next\", and \"maint\" to the value of this options."

(defcustom magit-branch-adjust-remote-upstream-alist nil
  "Alist of upstreams to be used when branching from remote branches.

When creating a local branch from an ephemeral branch located
on a remote, e.g. a feature or hotfix branch, then that remote
branch should usually not be used as the upstream branch, since
the push-remote already allows accessing it and having both the
upstream and the push-remote reference the same related branch
would be wasteful.  Instead a branch like \"maint\" or \"master\"
should be used as the upstream.

This option allows specifing the branch that should be used as
the upstream when branching certain remote branches.  The value
is an alist of the form ((UPSTREAM . RULE)...).  The first
matching element is used, the following elements are ignored.

UPSTREAM is the branch to be used as the upstream for branches
specified by RULE.  It can be a local or a remote branch.

RULE can either be a regular expression, matching branches whose
upstream should be the one specified by UPSTREAM.  Or it can be
a list of the only branches that should *not* use UPSTREAM; all
other branches will.  Matching is done after stripping the remote
part of the name of the branch that is being branched from.

If you use a finite set of non-ephemeral branches across all your
repositories, then you might use something like:

  ((\"origin/master\" \"master\" \"next\" \"maint\"))

Or if the names of all your ephemeral branches contain a slash,
at least in some repositories, then a good value could be:

  ((\"origin/master\" . \"/\"))

Of course you can also fine-tune:

  ((\"origin/maint\" . \"\\`hotfix/\")
   (\"origin/master\" . \"\\`feature/\"))"
