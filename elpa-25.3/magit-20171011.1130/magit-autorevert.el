This option is provided by `magit', which also redefines
`auto-revert-buffers' to respect it.  Magit users who do not turn
on the local mode `auto-revert-mode' themselves, are best served
by setting the value to `magit-auto-revert-repository-buffers-p'.

However the default is nil, to not disturb users who do use the
local mode directly.  If you experience delays when running Magit
commands, then you should consider using one of the predicates
provided by Magit - especially if you also use Tramp.

Users who do turn on `auto-revert-mode' in buffers in which Magit
doesn't do that for them, should likely not use any filter.
Users who turn on `global-auto-revert-mode', do not have to worry
about this option, because it is disregarded if the global mode
is enabled."

If `auto-revert-use-notify' is non-nil (and file notifications
are actually supported), then `magit-auto-revert-immediately'
does not have to be non-nil, because the reverts happen
immediately anyway.

If `magit-auto-revert-immediately' and `auto-revert-use-notify'

seconds of user inactivity.  That is not desirable."

     "Toggle Magit Auto Revert mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Magit Auto Revert mode if ARG
is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp,
enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.

Magit Auto Revert mode is a global minor mode that reverts
buffers associated with a file that is located inside a Git
repository when the file changes on disk.  Use `auto-revert-mode'
to revert a particular buffer.  Or use `global-auto-revert-mode'
to revert all file-visiting buffers, not just those that visit
a file located inside a Git repository.

This global mode works by turning on the buffer-local mode
`auto-revert-mode' at the time a buffer is first created.  The
local mode is turned on if the visited file is being tracked in
a Git repository at the time when the buffer is created.

If `magit-auto-revert-tracked-only' is non-nil (the default),
then only tracked files are reverted.  But if you stage a
previously untracked file using `magit-stage', then this mode
notices that.

Unlike `global-auto-revert-mode', this mode never reverts any
buffers that are not visiting files.

The behavior of this mode can be customized using the options
in the `autorevert' and `magit-autorevert' groups.

This function calls the hook `magit-auto-revert-mode-hook'.")
