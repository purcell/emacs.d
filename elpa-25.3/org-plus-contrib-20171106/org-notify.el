;;; Commentary:

;; Get notifications, when there is something to do.
;; Sometimes, you need a reminder a few days before a deadline, e.g. to buy a
;; present for a birthday, and then another notification one hour before to
;; have enough time to choose the right clothes.
;; For other events, e.g. rolling the dustbin to the roadside once per week,
;; you probably need another kind of notification strategy.
;; This package tries to satisfy the various needs.

;; In order to activate this package, you must add the following code
;; into your .emacs:
;;
;;   (require 'org-notify)
;;   (org-notify-start)

;; Example setup:
;;
;; (org-notify-add 'appt
;;                 '(:time "-1s" :period "20s" :duration 10
;;                   :actions (-message -ding))
;;                 '(:time "15m" :period "2m" :duration 100
;;                   :actions -notify)
;;                 '(:time "2h" :period "5m" :actions -message)
;;                 '(:time "3d" :actions -email))
;;
;; This means for todo-items with `notify' property set to `appt': 3 days
;; before deadline, send a reminder-email, 2 hours before deadline, start to
;; send messages every 5 minutes, then 15 minutes before deadline, start to
;; pop up notification windows every 2 minutes.  The timeout of the window is
;; set to 100 seconds.  Finally, when deadline is overdue, send messages and
;; make noise."

;; Take also a look at the function `org-notify-add'.

Each element of PARAMS is a list with parameters for a given time
distance to the deadline.  This distance must increase from one
element to the next.

List of possible parameters:

  :time      Time distance to deadline, when this type of notification shall
             start.  It's a string: an integral value (positive or negative)
             followed by a unit (s, m, h, d, w, M).
  :actions   A function or a list of functions to be called to notify the
             user.  Instead of a function name, you can also supply a suffix
             of one of the various predefined `org-notify-action-xxx'
             functions.
  :period    Optional: can be used to repeat the actions periodically.
             Same format as :time.
  :duration  Some actions use this parameter to specify the duration of the
             notification.  It's an integral number in seconds.
  :audible   Overwrite the value of `org-notify-audible' for this action.

For the actions, you can use your own functions or some of the predefined
ones, whose names are prefixed with `org-notify-action-'."
