;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This module implements inline tasks in Org mode.  Inline tasks are
;; tasks that have all the properties of normal outline nodes,
;; including the ability to store meta data like scheduling dates,
;; TODO state, tags and properties.  However, these nodes are treated
;; specially by the visibility cycling.
;;
;; Visibility cycling exempts these nodes from cycling.  So whenever
;; their parent is opened, so are these tasks.  This will only work
;; with `org-cycle', so if you are also using other commands to
;; show/hide entries, you will occasionally find these tasks to behave
;; like all other outline nodes, seemingly splitting the text of the
;; parent into children.
;;
;; Special fontification of inline tasks, so that they can be
;; immediately recognized.  From the stars of the headline, only the
;; first and the last two will be visible, the others will be hidden
;; using the `org-hide' face.
;;
;; An inline task is identified solely by a minimum outline level,
;; given by the variable `org-inlinetask-min-level', default 15.
;;
;; If you need to have a time planning line (DEADLINE etc), drawers,
;; for example LOGBOOK of PROPERTIES, or even normal text as part of
;; the inline task, you must add an "END" headline with the same
;; number of stars.
;;
;; As an example, here are two valid inline tasks:
;;
;;    **************** TODO a small task
;;
;; and
;;
;;    **************** TODO another small task
;;                     DEADLINE: <2009-03-30 Mon>
;;                     :PROPERTIES:
;;                       :SOMETHING: or other
;;                     :END:
;;                     And here is some extra text
;;    **************** END
;;
;; Also, if you want to use refiling and archiving for inline tasks,
;; The END line must be present to make things work properly.
;;
;; Note that you should not try to use inline tasks within plain list,
;; visibility cycling is known to be problematic when doing so.
;;
;; This package installs one new command:
;;
;; C-c C-x t      Insert a new inline task with END line
