Compile Emacs Lisp source files after the visiting buffers are saved.

After a buffer containing Emacs Lisp code is saved to its source
file update the respective byte code file.  If the latter does
not exist do nothing.  Therefore to disable automatic compilation
remove the byte code file.  See command `toggle-auto-compile' for
a convenient way to do so.

This mode should be enabled globally, using it's globalized
variant `auto-compile-on-save-mode'.  Also see the related
`auto-compile-on-load-mode'.

(autoload 'toggle-auto-compile "auto-compile" "\
Toggle automatic compilation of an Emacs Lisp source file or files.

Read a file or directory name from the minibuffer defaulting to
the visited Emacs Lisp source file or `default-directory' if no
such file is being visited in the current buffer.

If the user selects a file then automatic compilation of only
that file is toggled.  Since both `auto-compile-on-save' and
`auto-compile-on-save' only ever _recompile_ byte code files,
toggling automatic compilation is done simply by creating or
removing the respective byte code file.

If the user selects a directory then automatic compilation for
multiple files is toggled as follows:

* With a positive prefix argument always compile source files;
  with a negative prefix argument always remove byte code files.

* Otherwise the existence or absence of the byte code file of
  the source file that was current when this command was invoked
  determines whether byte code files should be created or removed.

* If no Emacs Lisp source file is being visited in the buffer
  that was current when the command was invoked ask the user what
  to do.

* When _removing_ byte code files then all byte code files are
  removed.  If `auto-compile-deletes-stray-dest' is non-nil this
  even includes byte code files for which no source file exists.

* When _creating_ byte code files only do so for source files
  that are actual libraries.  Source files that provide the
  correct feature are considered to be libraries; see
  `packed-library-p'.

* Note that non-libraries can still be automatically compiled,
  you just cannot _recursively_ turn on automatic compilation
  using this command.

* When `auto-compile-toggle-recompiles' is non-nil recompile all
  affected source files even when the respective source files are
  up-to-date.  Do so even for non-library source files.

* Only enter subdirectories for which `packed-ignore-directory-p'
  returns nil; i.e. don't enter hidden directories or directories
  containing a file named \".nosearch\".

A library needs to be recompiled if the source file is newer than
it's byte-compile destination.  Without this advice the outdated
byte code file would be loaded instead.
