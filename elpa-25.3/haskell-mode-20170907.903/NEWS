Haskell Mode NEWS                                -*- org -*-

* Changes in 2.8.0 (since 2.7.0)

See also [[https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode/compare/2_7_0...2_8_0][detailed Git history]].

- Minimal indentation support for arrow syntax

- Avoid opening a new inf-haskell window if one is already visible.
  Windows on other virtual desktops or iconified frames don't count.

- Force comint-process-echoes to nil

- Autolaunch haskell-mode for files starting with #!/usr/bin/runghc
  and similar

- Added minimal major mode for parsing GHC core files, courtesy of Johan Tibell.
  There is a corresponding Haskell menu entry.

- Allow configuration of where-clause indentation; M-x customize-group
  haskell-indentation.

* Changes since 2.6.4

- fill-paragraph (M-q) now only affects comments, and correctly
  handles Haddock commentary. adaptive-fill-mode is turned off, as it
  was interfering.

- Yet more unicode symbols

- Better support for unicode encoding of haskell source files

- mdo correctly indented

- Indentation fixes, fixes to the fixes, and fixes to the fixes to the
  fixes

- New command: M-x haskell-check, calls (by default) hlint on the
  current file. Also bound to C-c C-v.

  You can also use the flymake minor mode with this.

* Changes since 2.5.1

- Parser corrections for haskell-indentation and haskell-decl-scan

- haskell-indentation: Pressing tab in the rightmost position now
  moves to the leftmost, by default with a warning.

- Typo fix: One haskell-indentation variable had ended up in the
  haskell-ntation customize group.

- haskell-hoogle aliased to hoogle, haskell-hayoo aliased to hayoo

- Courtesy of Alex Ott:
  - Additional unicode symbols for font-lock-symbols: () == /= >= <= !! && || sqrt
  - M-x haskell-hayoo search added, opens using browse-url
  - Bug-fix for inferior-haskell-type

- If haskell-indentation errors out, it now fail-safes to inserting
  a literal newline or deleting one character, for return and
  backspace respectively.

* Changes since 2.4:

- haskell-indentation, a new minor mode for indentation.

* Changes since 2.3:

- Update license to GPLv3.

- New derived major mode for .hsc files.

- Removed the C-c C-r binding to reload a file.  You can still call
  inferior-haskell-reload-file (and/or bind it to your favorite key,
  including C-c C-r) or you can now use C-u C-c C-l.

- C-c C-d looks up the symbol at point in the Haddock docs.

- Haddock comments are highlighted with font-lock-doc-face if it exists.

- Use `tex' rather than `latex' for haskell-literate.

- inf-haskell.el tries to find the root of the module hierarchy to determine
  the root of a project (either by looking for a Cabal file or relying on
  the `module' declaration line).  If all works well, this will make C-c C-l
  automatically switch to the root dir, so that dependencies in other
  directories are automatically found.  If it doesn't, complain and/or set
  inferior-haskell-find-project-root to nil.

- The new command haskell-hoogle helps you query Hoogle from Emacs.

* Changes since 2.2:

- Trivial support for Cabal package description files.

- Minor bug fixes.

* Changes since 2.1:

- There are now commands to find type and info of identifiers by querying an
  inferior haskell process.  Available under C-c C-t, C-c C-i, and C-c M-.

- Indentation now looks back further, until a line that has no indentation.
  To recover the earlier behavior of stopping at the first empty line
  instead, configure haskell-indent-look-past-empty-line.

- inf-haskell can wait until a file load completes and jump directly to the
  first error, like haskell-ghci and haskell-hugs used to do.  See the var
  inferior-haskell-wait-and-jump.

* Changes since 2.0:

- inf-haskell uses ghci if hugs is absent.

- Fix up some binding conflicts (C-c C-o in haskell-doc)

- Many (hopefully minor) changes to the indentation.

- New symbols in haskell-font-lock-symbols-alist.

* Changes since 1.45:

- keybindings C-c <char> have been replaced by C-c C-<char> so as not
  to collide with minor modes.

- The following modules are now automatically activated without having to
  add anything to haskell-mode-hook:
  haskell-font-lock (just turn on global-font-lock-mode).
  haskell-decl-scan (just bind `imenu' to some key).

- In recent Emacsen, haskell-doc hooks into eldoc-mode.

- haskell-hugs and haskell-ghci are superceded by inf-haskell.

- Indentation rules have been improved when using layout inside parens/braces.

- Symbols like -> and \ can be displayed as actual arrows and lambdas.
  See haskell-font-lock-symbols.

- Tweaks to the font-lock settings.  Among other things paren-matching
  with things like \(x,y) should work correctly now.

- New maintainer <monnier@gnu.org>.
