What is done with lines which are not long enough is governed by
`mc/edit-lines-empty-lines'.  The prefix argument ARG can be used
to override this.  If ARG is a symbol (when called from Lisp),
that symbol is used instead of `mc/edit-lines-empty-lines'.
Otherwise, if ARG negative, short lines will be ignored.  Any
