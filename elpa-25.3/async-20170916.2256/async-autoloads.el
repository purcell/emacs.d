(autoload 'async-start-process "async" "\
Start the executable PROGRAM asynchronously.  See `async-start'.
PROGRAM is passed PROGRAM-ARGS, calling FINISH-FUNC with the
process object when done.  If FINISH-FUNC is nil, the future
object will return the process object when the program is
finished.  Set DEFAULT-DIRECTORY to change PROGRAM's current
working directory.

\(fn NAME PROGRAM FINISH-FUNC &rest PROGRAM-ARGS)" nil nil)

(autoload 'async-start "async" "\
Execute START-FUNC (often a lambda) in a subordinate Emacs process.
When done, the return value is passed to FINISH-FUNC.  Example:

    (async-start
       ;; What to do in the child process
       (lambda ()
         (message \"This is a test\")
         (sleep-for 3)
         222)

       ;; What to do when it finishes
       (lambda (result)
         (message \"Async process done, result should be 222: %s\"
                  result)))

If FINISH-FUNC is nil or missing, a future is returned that can
be inspected using `async-get', blocking until the value is
ready.  Example:

    (let ((proc (async-start
                   ;; What to do in the child process
                   (lambda ()
                     (message \"This is a test\")
                     (sleep-for 3)
                     222))))

        (message \"I'm going to do some work here\") ;; ....

        (message \"Waiting on async process, result should be 222: %s\"
                 (async-get proc)))

If you don't want to use a callback, and you don't care about any
return value from the child process, pass the `ignore' symbol as
the second argument (if you don't, and never call `async-get', it
will leave *emacs* process buffers hanging around):

    (async-start
     (lambda ()
       (delete-file \"a remote file on a slow link\" nil))
     'ignore)

Note: Even when FINISH-FUNC is present, a future is still
returned except that it yields no value (since the value is
passed to FINISH-FUNC).  Call `async-get' on such a future always
returns nil.  It can still be useful, however, as an argument to
`async-ready' or `async-wait'.
