1 Preliminary remarks
*********************

Emacs/W3 (http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/docs.html) once was the
most popular web browser on Emacs.  However, it worked so slowly that
we wanted a speedy alternative.  On the other hand, w3m
(http://w3m.sourceforge.net/) was a pager with WWW capability,
developed by Akinori ITO.  Although it was a pager, it was possible to
use it as a text-mode WWW browser, so we started developing an Emacs
interface to w3m.

   Our special thanks go to Akinori ITO and the w3m team for the
excellent w3m program.  We would also like to thank everybody who has
submitted comments, suggestions, and bug fixes.  Even though we're not
aware of any problems, all responsibility for this program is ours (the
emacs-w3m development team), but there is absolutely no warranty.  The
emacs-w3m program was first created by TSUCHIYA Masatoshi in June 2000.

   See also the emacs-w3m official page (http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/).

2 It's so easy to begin to use emacs-w3m
****************************************

Emacs-w3m may have already been installed on your system, in which case
you can skip this section and begin to use the program at once.  If
you're not that lucky, read on to learn how to install emacs-w3m.

File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Required Emacs Version,  Next: You Need w3m,  Up: Getting Started

2.1 What version of Emacs can be used?
======================================

You can run emacs-w3m in various versions of Emacsen listed below:

`Emacs 21.1 or greater'
     No additional packages are required.

`XEmacs 21.x'
     First of all, you should note that emacs-w3m supports only XEmacs
     21.4.17 and later and XEmacs 21.5-b19 and later.  In addition, you
     need to have installed the latest xemacs-base package including the
     `timer-funcs.el' module.

     The APEL package and the `gifsicle' program are required.  In
     addition, it would be better to have installed the `rfc2368.el'
     module which parses `mailto' urls (*note Other Requirements::).

`Emacs 20.x, Emacs 19.34 (including Mule 2.3)'
     Emacs-w3m no longer supports those Emacs versions.


   If you use the development version of GNU Emacs, perhaps you should
run the CVS version of emacs-w3m on it.  In that case, it is strongly
recommended that you join the *note Mailing List::.

2.2 Using w3m: the reason why emacs-w3m is fast
===============================================

Emacs-w3m uses the external w3m program as a back-end to retrieve web
contents and as an HTML rendering engine; that's how we could create an
accelerated Emacs web browser with asynchronous operation.

   You must install the latest w3m, it is available at:

   `http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/w3m/'


File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Other Requirements,  Next: Installing Emacs-w3m,  Prev: You Need w3m,  Up: Getting Started

2.3 Things required to run emacs-w3m
====================================

Depending on the Emacs version you're using, third party packages may be
required.  This section provides resources to help you find and install
them.

`APEL'
     Indispensable to XEmacs.  You should install APEL before building
     emacs-w3m.  APEL is available at:

     `http://kanji.zinbun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~tomo/lemi/dist/apel/'

     Note that you must not use the APEL XEmacs package (which is
     contained in SUMO) of the versions older than 1.32.  If you have
     already installed such a version, you should upgrade it or use the
     following directives to replace it with APEL which is linked above
     (you can also use the same directives in order to newly install
     APEL):

          % rm -fr /usr/local/lib/xemacs/xemacs-packages/lisp/apel
          % cd apel-10.7
          % make install-package XEMACS=xemacs-21.4.x\
            PACKAGEDIR=/usr/local/lib/xemacs/xemacs-packages

`gifsicle'
     Indispensable to XEmacs.  There is a known bug in all XEmacs 21.x
     series that won't let it display optimized animated gifs correctly
     or may make it crash when some kind of an interlaced gif image is
     displayed.  Emacs-w3m uses the `gifsicle' program to convert gif
     data in order to make it possible to be handled by XEmacs 21.x.
     It is available at:

     `http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/'

`ImageMagick'
     If the `convert' program bundled with the ImageMagick package is
     available on your system, emacs-w3m will use it to resize images
     or to convert `favicon' images into a format Emacs can handle.
     Emacs-w3m will work without ImageMagick, but installing it will
     improve your surfing experience.  You can get the ImageMagick
     package from:

     `ftp://ftp.imagemagick.org/pub/ImageMagick/'

     To manipulate `favicon' images, we recommend version 5.4.0-5 and
     later, previous versions may work but we didn't check them
     thoroughly.

`FLIM'
     The FLIM package is required to use the `shimbun' library.  The
     `shimbun' library is a collection of tools for reading web
     newspapers, you can use it with Gnus, Mew or Wanderlust.  *Note
     Shimbun Library::.

     Note that the FLIM package requires the APEL package regardless of
     the version of Emacs you are using.  Therefore, you must install
     both APEL and FLIM if you would like to use the `shimbun' library.
     The FLIM package is available at:

     `http://kanji.zinbun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~tomo/lemi/dist/flim/flim-1.14/'

`Mule-UCS'
     If you use XEmacs 21.4, or need to read Chinese text, Japanese
     text, Korean text, etc. using Emacs 21, we recommend you install
     the Mule-UCS Emacs Lisp package so as to enable emacs-w3m to
     display pages encoded by UTF-8, which is the typical coding system
     of the Unicode system.  Note that Emacs 21 supports the Unicode
     system partially (e.g., for Latin text) and Emacs 22 or greater
     fully supports it.  The Mule-UCS Emacs Lisp package is available
     at:

     `http://unit.aist.go.jp/itri/itri-gist/ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/Mule-UCS/test/Mule-UCS-current.tar.gz'

     (The official page for Mule-UCS will open in the near future in
     `http://www.meadowy.org/'.)

     If you use it with Emacs 21.2, it is necessary to apply this patch
     (http://www.m17n.org/mlarchive/mule/200203/msg00000.html) before
     installation.

     If you are an XEmacs 21.4 user, the compiled package is here:

     `ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/xemacs/packages/mule-ucs-1.14-pkg.tar.gz'

     (You don't need to install it in addition to Mule SUMO, that
     contains it.)

`codepage-ex'
     Some web sites in Europe specify a `charset=ISO-8859-1' encoding,
     but really use `windows-1252'.  Since `iso-8859-1' is insufficient
     to decode that, emacs-w3m uses `windows-1252' as a superset of
     `iso-8859-1' if it is available.  The `windows-1252' coding system
     is built-in since Emacs 22.  Even in Emacs 21, you can enable to
     use it using the module called `codepage-ex'.  See the following
     page:

     `http://nijino.homelinux.net/emacs/codepage-ex.html'

`rfc2368.el'
     Install it if you'd like to enable emacs-w3m running with XEmacs to
     parse `mailto' urls properly.  You can find the `rfc2368.el'
     module which can be used with XEmacs in the `attic' directory in
     the emacs-w3m distribution.  To install it, copy the `rfc2368.el'
     file to the directory belonging to the `load-path', and perform the
     following command:

          % xemacs -batch -vanilla -f batch-byte-compile rfc2368.el


File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Installing Emacs-w3m,  Next: Non-UNIX-like systems,  Prev: Other Requirements,  Up: Getting Started

2.4 Installing emacs-w3m
========================

See the official page `http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/' for instructions
on how to get the latest emacs-w3m.  Is everything ready?  Now, let's
begin.

   In order to install emacs-w3m on non-UNIX-like systems (or any system
lacking the ability to execute the `configure' script or has no `make'
command), skip this section and go to the next section *Note
Non-UNIX-like systems::.

  1. First, extract a tarball of the emacs-w3m distribution and enter
     the top directory as follows:

          % tar zxf emacs-w3m-1.4.402.tar.gz
          % cd emacs-w3m-1.4.402

     If you've checked out emacs-w3m from CVS, you have to run
     `autoconf' with no argument to generate the `configure' script.

  2. Run the `configure' script.

          % ./configure

     _Important notice to Gnus users_:

     If multiple versions of Gnus are installed on your system (it is
     likely that there are the released version and the development
     version of Gnus), make sure that the `load-path' contains the
     directory where the version you use is installed (check for the
     `gnus.elc' file).  You can ensure that with the `--with-addpath'
     option as follows:

          % ./configure --with-addpath=/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/gnus

     If you've installed APEL, FLIM or something in

     non-standard directories other than the default `load-path', you
     must specify them using the `--with-addpath' option as follows (you
     may also include the Gnus directory in it separated with `:'):

          % ./configure --with-addpath=/opt/share/apel:/opt/share/flim

  3. Just run `make' and `make install'.  See also the next step if you
     are using XEmacs.

          % make
          % make install

     All Lisp and info files will be installed in the appropriate
     directories.  Now, how do you know what files will go where?  To
     know it beforehand, use this:

          % make what-where

     If you are using Emacs or XEmacs capable of displaying images, you
     had better install icon image files.  To do this:

          % make install-icons

     or

          % make install-icons30

     The later is for using the slightly larger icon images.

  4. You can also install emacs-w3m as an XEmacs package using `make
     install-package' instead of `make install' as follows:

          % make
          % make install-package

     In this case, you don't have to execute `make install-icons' nor
     `make install-icons30'.

     If you need to specify the package directory, there are two ways
     to do that:

        * Use the `configure' option `--with-packagedir='.  For example:

               % ./configure --with-packagedir=/opt/xemacs/xemacs-packages
               % make what-where
               % make
               % make install-package

        * Use the `PACKAGEDIR' variable.  For example:

               % ./configure
               % make what-where PACKAGEDIR=/opt/xemacs/xemacs-packages
               % make
               % make install-package PACKAGEDIR=/opt/xemacs/xemacs-packages

2.5 Installing on non-UNIX-like systems
=======================================

If you cannot execute the `configure' script on your system, or if no
`make' command is available, cast the following spell:

     % emacs -batch -q -no-site-file -l w3mhack.el NONE -f w3mhack-nonunix-install

   If APEL, FLIM (or any other library) aren't installed in the
ordinary places, the installer will leave them out.  In such a case, it
is necessary to tell those places to the installer as shown below:

     % emacs -batch -q -no-site-file -l w3mhack.el //c/share/apel://c/share/flim -f w3mhack-nonunix-install


File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Minimal Settings,  Prev: Non-UNIX-like systems,  Up: Getting Started

2.6 Minimal settings to run emacs-w3m
=====================================

This section mentions some fundamental settings for emacs-w3m.  If you
want to fine-tune your installation, you'll find many customizable
variables in *note Customizable Variables::.

`Autoloads'
     You don't need this if you've installed emacs-w3m as an XEmacs
     package (*note Installing Emacs-w3m::) because the
     `w3m/auto-autoloads.el' takes care of setting up autoloads.

     In all other cases, put the following line in your `~/.emacs' file:

          (require 'w3m-load)

`Startup File'
     We recommend using the `~/.emacs-w3m' file (which is the default
     value of `w3m-init-file') if you need to twiddle some emacs-w3m
     variables.  This file is similar to `~/.emacs', but is read when
     emacs-w3m starts.  Note that some options shouldn't be modified
     there, for example, `w3m-command'.

`Proxy Gateway'
     If you are behind a firewall and access the Internet through a
     proxy gateway, you need to instruct w3m to use it.

     There are several ways to do this, one is to set the `http_proxy'
     environment variable globally in the shell something like:

          setenv http_proxy http://proxy.hogege.com:8000/

     Another way is to customize the `w3m-command-arguments' variable to
     add the options `-o' and
     `http_proxy=http://PROXY_SERVER_NAME:PORT/'.

     This can also be done in your `~/.emacs-w3m' file as shown below:

          (setq w3m-command-arguments
                (nconc w3m-command-arguments
                       '("-o" "http_proxy=http://proxy.hogege.com:8000/")))

     To specify hosts for which the proxy shouldn't be used (Intranet
     sites and the like), set the `no_proxy' (note that it is not
     `no-proxy') environment variable to a comma-separated list of
     hostnames.  Alternatively, you can set the `w3m-no-proxy-domains'
     variable to a list of domain names (not host names) as follows:

          (setq w3m-no-proxy-domains '("local.com" "neighbor.com"))

     See also the documentation of the `w3m-command-arguments-alist'
     variable for instructions on how to use regexps to specify
     `no_proxy' hosts.

3.1 Let's go netsurfing!
========================

You can, by the keys, let emacs-w3m do all the web browsing operations.
Emacs-w3m uses the `Lynx-like' keymap (*note Key Binding::) by default.
Of course, you can use the mouse buttons, too.

3.1.1 There are two types of the key bindings
---------------------------------------------

Since emacs-w3m is a late-coming web browser in the history of Emacs web
browsers, we offer two types of the key bindings in order that users can
get used to the new web browser easily.  One is called the `Lynx-like'
keymap, the other is the `Info-like' keymap.  You can see what they
mean from those names, can't you?  The former is similar to that of
`Lynx' which is the text-based web browser, and the later is similar to
that of `Info' which is GNU's official document browser.  By default,
the `Lynx-like' keymap is used.  If you would like to use the
`Info-like' keymap, type

     M-x customize-option <RET> w3m-key-binding <RET>

choose the `Info-like' keymap, and save the changed state.  Otherwise,
add the following snippet to your `~/.emacs' file, not
`~/.emacs-w3m.el' file:

     (setq w3m-key-binding 'info)

   To change the key binding one by one, modify the `w3m-mode-map'
variable in your `~/.emacs-w3m.el' file like the following:

     (define-key w3m-mode-map [up] 'previous-line)
     (define-key w3m-mode-map [down] 'next-line)
     (define-key w3m-mode-map [left] 'backward-char)
     (define-key w3m-mode-map [right] 'forward-char)

3.1.2 Go ahead, just try it
---------------------------

You can invoke emacs-w3m using three different commands, listed below.
Try one of these commands: a web page is displayed in an Emacs buffer
named "*w3m*", meaning that it is an emacs-w3m buffer.  As you will
probably notice, the major mode for an emacs-w3m buffer is `w3m-mode',
there are also minor modes (*note Managing Bookmarks::).

   This section explains the most fundamental usage of these commands,
see *note Emacs-w3m Functions:: for more information on them.  See also
*note Customizable Variables:: for variables you can use to customize
emacs-w3m's behavior.

`w3m'
     Start emacs-w3m, displaying the homepage specified in the
     `w3m-home-page' variable.  The default value for `w3m-home-page'
     is "about:".  Set the `w3m-quick-start' variable to `nil' if you
     want to input a target URL every time you start emacs-w3m.

     You can also use this as an argument when starting emacs.
     Examples:

          % emacs -f w3m

     To specify a URL, you could also use:

          % emacs -f w3m http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/

`w3m-find-file'
     Prompt for a local file name in the minibuffer, and display it in
     emacs-w3m.

`w3m-browse-url'
     Prompt for a URL in the minibuffer, and display it in emacs-w3m.
     This command is provided, if anything, in order to start emacs-w3m
     from other application programs.

   Moving in an emacs-w3m buffer won't be painful if you're an Emacs
user already, since many of the standard keys work as intended.  For
instance, `C-n', `C-v' and `C-s' (which are commonly used to move down
one line, one page, or search downwards for a word) are valid keys in
an emacs-w3m buffer.

   To follow a link, use the `<RET>' key.  You have to move the point
to a link to do this; links are easily recognizable in a buffer because
they are not displayed like ordinary text: they can be underlined, or
have a different color.  The face `w3m-anchor' controls how they are to
be displayed (*note Customizable Variables::).

`<RET>'
`<right>' (Lynx-like keymap only)
     Display the page pointed by the link under point
     (`w3m-view-this-url').

     The exact behavior of this command depends on the properties of
     the link under point, and on whether you give it a prefix argument
     or not.  See *note Emacs-w3m Functions:: for details.

   As mentioned above, you can be prompted for a URL when you use the
command `M-x w3m', by setting the `w3m-quick-start' variable to `nil'.
In an emacs-w3m buffer, there are also two popular ways to go to new
pages by entering their URLs, see below.

`<RET>'
     In an emacs-w3m buffer, you can be prompted for a URL in the
     minibuffer and make emacs-w3m display the corresponding page by
     hitting `<RET>' after moving the point to the URL displayed in the
     `header-line'.  This feature will feel familiar to you if you are
     used to GUI-based web browsers like Mozilla.  Detailed explanations
     about this can be found in *note Emacs-w3m Functions::
     (`w3m-view-this-url').

`g'
     Prompt for a URL in the minibuffer and make emacs-w3m display the
     corresponding page (independently of the position of the point) in
     an emacs-w3m buffer.  This binding will be familiar to you if you
     already use Gnus or Mew (`w3m-goto-url').

`G'
     Prompt for a URL in the minibuffer, and display it in a new
     session.  This function works just like `g' (`M-x w3m-goto-url')),
     except that it opens a new session.  Unless you are using
     emacs-w3m on the character terminal, opening a new session means
     displaying the page in a new tab.  For more information about
     tabs, please refer to *note Using Tabs::
     (`w3m-goto-url-new-session').

`c' (Lynx-like keymap)
`y' (Info-like keymap)
     Display the URL of the page being displayed in the echo area and
     put it in the `kill-ring' (`w3m-print-current-url').

`u' (Lynx-like keymap)
`Y' (Info-like keymap)
     Display the target URL of the link under point in the echo area
     and put it in the `kill-ring' (`w3m-print-this-url').

   If the page you're reading is today's news or someone's diary, it may
have been updated since you loaded it.  You can refresh the page using
the following command.  (This command can also be useful to force a full
redisplay of the page if it looks broken.)

`R'
`C-S-l' (Info-like keymap only)
     Reload the page (`w3m-reload-this-page').

3.1.3 Moving from place to place in a page
------------------------------------------

Being able to use familiar Emacs movement bindings while browsing a web
page probably fascinates you already.  Believe it or not, there is
more!  Since we value your time, we have added keys to move the point,
scroll the page or find links in a very fast way.  When you master
them, you will understand how handy they are.

   The keys are assigned so that scroll commands can be called using
shorter keystrokes than standard Emacs key bindings.  And since places
where you can input text are pretty specific in web pages (*note
Submitting Forms::), most keys have special meanings and aren't
assigned to `self-insert-command' anymore.

`<SPC>'
     Scroll downwards.  You may be used to this binding if you use the
     `more' or `less' commands, or Emacs's `view-mode'
     (`w3m-scroll-up-or-next-url').

`<DEL>'
`b'
`<backspace>'
`S-<SPC>'
`C-?'
     Scroll upwards.  You may be used to this binding if you use the
     `less' command or Emacs's `view-mode'
     (`w3m-scroll-down-or-previous-url').

`>'
     Scroll to the left.  The scroll step is given by the
     `w3m-horizontal-scroll-columns' variable, default 10
     (`w3m-scroll-left').

`<'
     Scroll to the right.  The scroll step is given by the
     `w3m-horizontal-scroll-columns' variable, default 10
     (`w3m-scroll-right').

`.' (Lynx-like keymap)
`S-<left>' (Info-like keymap)
     Shift to the left (a fine level horizontal scrolling).  The shift
     step is given by the `w3m-horizontal-shift-columns' variable,
     default 2 (`w3m-shift-left').

`,' (Lynx-like keymap)
`S-<right>' (Info-like keymap)
     Shift to the right (a fine level horizontal scrolling).  The shift
     step is given by the `w3m-horizontal-shift-columns' variable,
     default 2 (`w3m-shift-right').

`M-l'
     Scroll horizontally so that the current position is centered
     (`w3m-horizontal-recenter').

   The `w3m-mode' major mode defines commands to move to various kinds
of things; namely links, forms, and images (whether they are displayed
or not).

   Let's consider this simple example: suppose we want to search for a
word on the widely-known Google search engine.  Step one: open
`http://www.google.com' in emacs-w3m.  Step two: once the page is
loaded, hit `]'.  Tadaa!  The point has moved to the first form input
in the page, you can now hit `<RET>' to enter something in it, and then
`C-c C-c' to submit.  Without this command, you would have had to move
into the page using `C-n', `C-f' and so forth, it would have been a
real pain.

`<TAB>'
`<down>' (Lynx-like keymap only)
     Move the point to the next link (an "anchor" in emacs-w3m lingo).
     More strictly speaking, move the point forwards to the nearest
     anchor.

`M-<TAB>'
`S-<TAB>'
`<backtab>'
`<up>' (Lynx-like keymap only)
     Move the point to the previous anchor.  More strictly speaking,
     move the point backwards to the nearest anchor
     (`w3m-previous-anchor').

`]'
     Move the point to the next form.  More strictly speaking, move the
     point forwards to the nearest form (`w3m-next-form').

`['
     Move the point to the previous form.  More strictly speaking, move
     the point backwards to the nearest form (`w3m-previous-form').

`}'
     Move the point to the next image.  More strictly speaking, move the
     point forwards to the nearest image (`w3m-next-image').

`{'
     Move the point to the previous image.  More strictly speaking,
     move the point backwards to the nearest image
     (`w3m-previous-image').

3.1.4 Moving from page to page
------------------------------

This section explains how to move from page to page, but not by
following links or inputing URLs (these ways of moving are explained in
*note Launching and Jumping::).

   This includes commands to move backwards and forwards in history (the
familiar "Back" and "Forward" from other browsers), and the obligatory
"Go to the home page" feature.  You will probably understand this
better after reading the *note Tracing History:: section.

`B' (Lynx-like keymap)
`<left>' (Lynx-like keymap)
`l' (Info-like keymap)
`p' (Info-like keymap)
     Move back one page in history (`w3m-view-previous-page').  With a
     numeric argument ARG, move back ARG pages.  This is the preferred
     way to go back in time.

`N' (Lynx-like keymap)
`n' (Info-like keymap)
     Move forward one page in history (`w3m-view-next-page').  Of
     course, this will work only if you've used `B' (`l' for the
     `Info-like' keymap) to move back in history.  If called with a
     numeric argument ARG, move forward ARG pages. This command actually
     allows you to go back to the future!

`H'
     Move to the home page (`w3m-gohome').  You can specify the URL of
     the home page by customizing the `w3m-home-page' variable
     ("about:" by default).

   These commands are exclusive features of emacs-w3m, we were able to
obtain patents on them, so you won't find them anywhere else.  That's
why you must learn to use them today!  (Just kidding.)

`^'
`u' (Info-like keymap only)
     Attempt to move to the parent directory of the page currently
     displayed.  For instance, it will attempt to move to
     "http://foo/bar/" when "http://foo/bar/baz" is displayed.  This
     function has been implemented because of the following
     observation: users of web browsers often have to move up one level
     of directories because the information they're looking for isn't
     displayed on the current page (either because it has been deleted,
     or because a search engine took them to the wrong page).

     When you use another web browser, you usually need to remove the
     last component from the URL by using the `<DEL>' key, etc. several
     times manually.  In emacs-w3m, this operation can be performed in
     only one keystroke, by typing `^'!

     Also, you type this command with prefix as "2 ^", you visit the
     upper directory according to input number. you type "0 ^", you
     visit the top of this site.

`<SPC>'
     When the current point is located at the end of the buffer and you
     cannot scroll down further, hit the `<SPC>' key to go on to the
     "next page" (`w3m-scroll-up-or-next-url').  Here, "next page"
     means the page referred to in the special "next" header of the
     current page (read on).  This feature has nothing to do with the
     history.

     You probably noticed that some websites split their contents over
     several small pages, partly because it's not comfortable for users
     to wait for huge contents to transfer in one go.  For example,
     search results of search engines often appear like that.  On such
     sites, users often need to follow links manually from one page to
     the next in order the access all the information.

     Hopefully emacs-w3m attempts to enable you to browse a series of
     contents over pages as if you were viewing them as a single page,
     by combining two operations: explicitly following links and
     scrolling.

     That's how it works: these kinds of websites often have fields
     such as "next", "prev" or "previous" in the headers of their web
     pages.  These fields contain information about links between
     divided pages.  Emacs-w3m uses these fields to know what to follow.

     Let's take an example with Google again to explain how the two
     operations (following links and scrolling) are combined.  Open
     `http://www.google.com' and search for a word.  If you search for a
     very common word (e.g. "hamburger"), you will get tons of search
     results.  Google returns the first page of search results, after
     having sorted them using its own algorithm and divided them into
     several pages.  Use `<SPC>' to scroll through this first page.
     Keep scrolling until you see the end of the web page in the
     window.  Here, a surprise is waiting for you.  If you use a web
     browser other than emacs-w3m and want to see the rest of the
     search results, you would have to click on any of the numbers
     listed under

          Gooooooogle

          1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8...

     to follow the link.  But with emacs-w3m, you can follow the link
     by just typing `<SPC>', just as if you were scrolling!

`<DEL>'
`b'
`<backspace>'
`S-<SPC>'
`C-?'
     When the point is located at the beginning of the buffer and you
     cannot scroll upward, hit the `<DEL>' to go to the "previous" page
     (`w3m-scroll-down-or-previous-url').  Here, the "previous" page
     means the page which is assigned to the "prev" or "previous" fields
     in the header of the current page.  This function has nothing to
     do with the history, and works like `<SPC>'
     (w3m-scroll-up-or-next-url).

3.1.5 Surfing using the mouse
-----------------------------

The emacs-w3m developers went to some trouble to ensure that normal
people who aren't Emacs otaku can also use emacs-w3m.  You can perform
most web browsing operations using only the mouse except for entering
text, e.g. URL, forms, etc.  Note that sometimes you might still need to
use modifier keys since the emacs-w3m developers are all Emacs otaku...

   Use `mouse-2' to "follow links" (the first basic of web browsing).
Under Emacs 22.1 and newer, you can also follow links using `mouse-1',
depending of the value of `mouse-1-click-follows-link'.

`mouse-2'
     Follow the link under the mouse pointer
     (`w3m-mouse-view-this-url').

`S-<mouse-2>'
     Follow the link under the mouse pointer in a new session
     (`w3m-mouse-view-this-url-new-session').

   Scrollbar, menubar and toolbar are helpful in emacs-w3m when you use
a mouse (your Emacs must support them, and you must have enabled them).
You can scroll an emacs-w3m window using the scrollbar.  You can invoke
many emacs-w3m commands described in this manual from the "w3m" menu
which appears at the top of the Emacs frame.  Note: it's not necessary
to use the menubar for most emacs-w3m commands, you can use the toolbar
icons instead.

   To switch between buffers in an emacs-w3m window using "Tabs" (*note
Using Tabs::), click on the topmost line in an emacs-w3m window
directory using `mouse-2' or choose one from the "Tab" menu which
appears next but one to the "w3m" menu.

3.1.6 Return to an Ordinary Life
--------------------------------

Think back.  You probably didn't start Emacs to browse the web, but to,
say, replace some editor's built-in interpreter with scheme, write Info
documentation or put into print your opinion on software patents...
who knows?  While you were using Emacs, you ran into the need to browse
the web for your work.  But you happened to be able to see the web page
without leaving Emacs at all.  Wow.

   Now the time has come to return to work.  Keep it up or the world
won't change!  Type `q' if you think you might need to browse the web
again.  Type `Q' if you don't have any intention to go back to
emacs-w3m for a while.

`q'
     Close an emacs-w3m window and select the other buffer
     (`w3m-close-window').

`Q'
     Save the "arrived URLs" list to disk (*note Tracing History::),
     save cookies (*note Cookie Variables::) and really quit emacs-w3m
     (`w3m-quit').


File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Inline Images,  Next: Tracing History,  Prev: Browsing Web Pages,  Up: Basic Usage

3.2 Toggle displaying inline images
===================================

If the Emacs version you're using is capable of displaying images in
buffers, then emacs-w3m can display them in web pages, just like
"graphical" browsers like Mozilla do.  You should make sure your Emacs
is correctly setup for images before trying to use any of the following
commands (*note Required Emacs Version::).

   To toggle displaying of images in the current buffer, use `T' (`I'
for the `Info-like' keymap).  It makes emacs-w3m fetch the images from
the server, then display them in the buffer, at the position they would
have in a "graphical" browser. If you hit the key again, images will
disappear from the buffer.

   By default, emacs-w3m won't display images, but you can change its
behavior and choose to always display images, for this you need to
customize the `w3m-default-display-inline-images' variable and change
its value from `nil' to `t'.  *Note Customizable Variables::.

   Emacs-w3m also comes with nifty features that let you zoom an image
in or out, save it to a file, or view it in a external viewer.  See also
*note Moving in a page:: for instructions on how to move from image to
image in an emacs-w3m buffer.

`T' (Lynx-like keymap)
`I' (Info-like keymap)
     Toggle displaying of all the inline images in this buffer
     (`w3m-toggle-inline-images').  If and only if
     `transient-mark-mode' is turned on and the region is active, only
     the images within the region will be turned on.

     Note1: whether to display inline images in a page from the start
     when you first visit the page is controlled by the value of the
     variable `w3m-default-display-inline-images' (the default is off)
     as mentioned above.  But the visibility of images in pages that
     you visit from this buffer inherits the last status of the
     visibility in this buffer if
     `w3m-toggle-inline-images-permanently' is non-`nil' (default=`t').
     If `w3m-toggle-inline-images-permanently' is `nil',
     `w3m-default-display-inline-images' always controls it.

     Note2: this command deactivates the region, so you have to set it
     again if you want to turn on only the images in a certain area
     again.

`t' (Lynx-like keymap)
`i' (Info-like keymap)
     Toggle displaying of the single inline image under the cursor
     (`w3m-toggle-inline-image').  If and only if `transient-mark-mode'
     is turned on and the region is active, only the images within the
     region will be turned on.  For the `Info-like keymap', this key is
     bound to the command (`w3m-view-image') that launches the external
     viewer if Emacs does not support displaying images.

`M-S-t' (Lynx-like keymap)
`M-S-i' (Info-like keymap)
     Turn off displaying of all the inline images in this buffer.
     (`w3m-turnoff-inline-images').

`I' (Lynx-like keymap)
     View the image under point in an external viewer
     (`w3m-view-image').

`M-i'
     Save the image under point to an external file.  The default name
     will be the original name of the image, so most of the time
     `M-i <RET>' will save the image with the right name
     (`w3m-save-image').

`M-['
     Zoom out the image under point (`w3m-zoom-out-image').

`M-]'
     Zoom in the image under point (`w3m-zoom-in-image').

3.3 Going back through time and space
=====================================

Emacs-w3m has several ways to present you with a list of all the pages
you visited before.  The first way is simply called the "emacs-w3m
history", it is a list of the pages you visited in this session,
presented hierarchically, that is: when you follow a link, the page
you're leaving becomes the "parent" of the page you're going to.  It is
a very nice to keep track of the pages you visited, and remember from
where you came if the history gets too long.

   Here is an example of this feature in action, after a short visit to
the GNU Project's homepage:

     GNU's Not Unix! - the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation (FSF)
       Philosophy of the GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF)
         GNU Emacs - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF)
          Order from the Free Software Foundation (FSF)
       Links to Other Free Software Sites - GNU Project - Free Software Fo...
         EFF: Homepage

   (In fact, this example is slightly edited to fit in 72 columns; the
URLs won't be cut in the actual emacs-w3m buffer.)

   You can get this kind of history using the `s' key (the `o' key for
the `Info-like' keymap) in any emacs-w3m buffer.

   Please note that this history is buffer-local, i.e. specific to an
emacs-w3m buffer.  But emacs-w3m has a unique feature: when you visit a
new page, the history is copied over to the new buffer, so that you can
still access the pages you visited so far.  This is different from the
way Mozilla and others work; in these browsers the history always starts
from scratch in new buffers.

   Emacs-w3m can do more than just record which pages you visited, it
can also save specific locations in those pages, in case you want to go
back to the exact same place in the page.  Press `C-c C-@', and the
location of the cursor will be stored in history.  In order to go back
to that particular location within the page, press `C-c C-v' in the
emacs-w3m buffer visiting the page.

`s' (Lynx-like keymap)
`C-u s' (Lynx-like keymap)
`o' (Info-like keymap)
`C-u o' (Info-like keymap)
     Display the list of URLs visited in this session.  If called with a
     prefix argument (see below), show the list of arrived URLs instead
     (`w3m-history').

`C-c C-@'
`C-c C-<SPC>'

`C-c C-v'
     Move to the position which has been marked with `C-c C-@'
     (`w3m-history-store-position') in the currently displayed page.

   The other way to have information about past pages is the "arrived
URLs" list: it is a list of the last 500 URLs you have visited in
emacs-w3m.  The list is ordered by date, the most recent coming first,
and for each page the time of visit is displayed.  Here's an example

command, i.e. using `C-u s' (`C-u o' for the `Info-like' keymap).  The
number of URLs showed in this page is customizable, see the
`w3m-keep-arrived-urls' variable.  It cannot exceed 500 by default.

3.4 That's a favorite with me!
==============================

Like all modern browsers, emacs-w3m has advanced features related to
bookmarks: it lets you classify them in categories, edit them and of
course, browse them easily.

* Menu:

* Adding Bookmarks::            Adding a URL to your favorites
* Consulting Bookmarks::        Browse your bookmarks
* Editing Bookmarks::           How to change your bookmarks


File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Adding Bookmarks,  Next: Consulting Bookmarks,  Up: Managing Bookmarks

3.4.1 Adding a URL to your favorites
------------------------------------

There are several ways to add a URL to your bookmarks.  The first one is
to use the `a' key (or call the `w3m-bookmark-add-current-url' command)
to add the page you're currently browsing: it will prompt you for a
section to where the bookmark should go (completion is available with
the `<TAB>' key) and will let you edit the title of the bookmark (the
default being the title of the current page).  Complete these two
steps, validating each with `<RET>', and you will see the message
"Added" in the minibuffer, which means (surprise!) that the page has
been added to your bookmarks.

   Another way to add a bookmark is to use the `M-a' key (or call the
`w3m-bookmark-add-this-url' command): it adds the URL under point (that
means, the URL you would be taken to if you followed the link) to the
bookmarks.  As before, you will have to input the section for this
bookmark and its title, the default being this time the name of the
link itself.

   The third and final way to do this is to use `C-u a', this time you
will be prompted for the URL to add, its section, and the title to use
for it in the bookmarks.

`a'
     Add the current page to the bookmarks, or if called with a prefix
     argument, prompt for a URL and add it
     (`w3m-bookmark-add-current-url').

`M-a'
     Add the URL under point to the bookmarks
     (`w3m-bookmark-add-this-url').


File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Consulting Bookmarks,  Next: Editing Bookmarks,  Prev: Adding Bookmarks,  Up: Managing Bookmarks

3.4.2 Browse your bookmarks
---------------------------

The easiest way to see the bookmarks is to use the `v' key in an
emacs-w3m buffer; another possibility is to go to the special URL
`about://bookmark/'.  You will see your bookmarks, organized by
section, each line being one bookmark.  You can browse them exactly
like you would browse any other page.

   On the bookmarks page a w3m minor mode is activated, the bookmark
mode.  It adds key bindings to edit the bookmarks.  *Note Editing
Bookmarks::.

`v'
     Visit the bookmarks page (`w3m-bookmark-view').


File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Editing Bookmarks,  Prev: Consulting Bookmarks,  Up: Managing Bookmarks

3.4.3 How to change your bookmarks
----------------------------------

The bookmark minor mode (*note Consulting Bookmarks::) offers several
key bindings related to bookmark edition, most noticeably `C-k' to kill
(i.e. delete) a bookmark, and `E' (`e' for the `Info-like' keymap) to
edit the bookmark file.

   Bookmarks are kept in an HTML file, so you can edit the file by hand,
but be very careful: if you erase the comments emacs-w3m needs to
recognize section names, things can break easily.  If you know the
basics of HTML, the file should otherwise be quite self-explanatory.

`C-k'
     Kill the bookmark under point (`w3m-bookmark-kill-entry').

`E'
     Visit the bookmarks file (`w3m-bookmark-edit').

`C-_'
     Undo the last changes (`w3m-bookmark-undo').


File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Using Tabs,  Next: Working with buffers,  Prev: Managing Bookmarks,  Up: Basic Usage

3.5 Everybody likes tabs
========================

Unlike most other text-based browsers, emacs-w3m has support for tabbed
browsing.  What is tabbed browsing, you might ask?  It's very simple: it
is a way to represent all active emacs-w3m buffers in a single window,
by showing a line at the top which shows all the buffers in a simple and
self-explaining way, each buffer being shown as a "tab".  This line
stays visible all the time and does not scroll with the rest of the
buffer, so that you can switch to another buffer, or use the feedback it
provides at any moment.

   The easiest way to get the feeling of it is to just try, so go on and
open an emacs-w3m session.  If you didn't change anything to the
configuration, the tabs line is active by default, it is this bright
line at the top with a smaller rectangle that shows the title of the
current page.  Now create another w3m buffer (with `G', for example):
now you have two of these rectangles.  These are tabs.

   The most obvious use of tabs is switching: by clicking with the
`mouse-1' button on a tab, you make the buffer it represents active.
It also works with the `mouse-2' button, or with rolling the mouse
wheel if you are using GNU Emacs.  It's a very quick and easy way to
work with several emacs-w3m buffers, you just have to point and click,
or to roll the mouse wheel.  (Yeah yeah, I hear you.  You want to switch
using the keyboard.  Don't worry, it's also possible.  It's explained in
the next section.  Now keep quiet and read on!)

   Another nifty feature is the feedback it provides.  If you are on a
color terminal or window system, emacs-w3m shows the text in the tab in
different colors to show the status of the page(1).  For example, when
the page is being loaded, the text is in red, and goes back to its
default color (usually black) when the loading is complete.  This way
you can tell with a single glance at the tabs line if the page you're
waiting for has arrived or not.

   Finally, if the web page provides a favicon, it will be shown in the
tab as well(2).  More eye-candy for the emacs-w3m user!

   User options:

`w3m-use-tab'
     Whether to activate tabbed browsing or not.

   If you are a GNU Emacs user, the mouse wheel allows you not only to
go to an adjacent buffer but also to move a buffer to the adjacent
place.  To do that, press and hold down the control key while you roll
the mouse wheel on the tabs line.  There are two variables that control
how emacs-w3m behaves by the mouse wheel:

`w3m-tab-track-mouse'
     This variable controls whether to make the mouse track the
     selected tab.  The default value is `t'.  You may want to set this
     to `nil' if you use a proportional font for the tab faces.  See
     also `w3m-tab-mouse-position-adjuster'.

`w3m-tab-mouse-position-adjuster'
     This variable contains the values used to adjust the mouse
     position on tabs when the mouse pointer tracks the selected tab.
     The default value is `(0.5 . -4)'.  It consists of the cons of a
     floating point number M and an integer N that are applied to
     calculating of the mouse position, which is given in pixel units,
     as follows:

          (TAB_WIDTH + M) * ORDER + N

     Where TAB_WIDTH is the pixel width of a tab and ORDER is the order
     number in tabs.  The result is rounded towards zero.

     Note that the calculation will always fail if you use a
     proportional font for the tab faces.  See also
     `w3m-tab-track-mouse'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Although XEmacs shows all tabs in the same colors at every
moment, you can easily distinguish the selected tab and others and see
the status of the current page in the modeline.

   (2) Under XEmacs, favicons will currently not be shown in the tabs
line.

3.6 Creating, killing and moving across buffers
===============================================

Sooner or later, you will be addicted to emacs-w3m, and you'll have to
manage all your browsing needs with it.  To help you with this daunting
task, we have imagined many different ways to work with emacs-w3m
buffers.

* Menu:

* Creating and killing buffers:: Creating and killing buffers
* Moving across buffers::        Moving across buffers
* Selecting buffers::            Selecting buffers from a list


File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Creating and killing buffers,  Next: Moving across buffers,  Up: Working with buffers

3.6.1 Creating and killing buffers
----------------------------------

It is sometimes useful to just create a new buffer without opening a web
page in it.  This operation is called "creating a twin copy" of a
buffer, in emacs-w3m lingo.  It will simply create a new buffer whose
contents are identical to the currently active buffer.

   The opposite of this is closing buffers: you can just close one
buffer (because you're not interested in its contents anymore) or you
can decide to close all buffers but the current one.  Emacs-w3m lets
you do this with the following commands:

`C-c C-t'
`M-n'
     Create an identical copy of the currently active buffer, under a
     new name.  This is used to start a new session without loading a
     web page in the new buffer (`w3m-copy-buffer').

`C-c C-w'
     Close the current emacs-w3m buffer (`w3m-delete-buffer').

`C-c M-w'
     Close all emacs-w3m buffers, but the active one
     (`w3m-delete-other-buffers').


File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Moving across buffers,  Next: Selecting buffers,  Prev: Creating and killing buffers,  Up: Working with buffers

3.6.2 Moving across buffers
---------------------------

The commands you will probably use most often are those who allow you
to go to an adjacent buffer; that is a buffer just "after" or "before"
the current one.  The meaning of this will be obvious if you use tabs:
the next buffer is the one just after the active one, on the right, and
the previous buffer is the one on the left.  However, XEmacs displays
tabs in random order unfortunately, so you need to pay attention to the
number which is displayed in each tab in order to know what is the
adjacent buffer if you are using XEmacs.  The key bindings for these
commands are `C-c C-p' and `C-c C-n'.

   These commands understand the numeric argument convention, i.e. if
you call them with a number N as argument, you will be taken N buffers
away from the current one.  For example, to go two buffers on the right
from the current position, use `2 C-c C-n'(1).

`C-c C-p'
     Move to the previous emacs-w3m buffer.  This is usually the next
     buffer to the left in the tabs line.  If called with a numeric
     argument N, move N buffers to the previous (`w3m-previous-buffer').

`C-c C-n'
     Move to the next emacs-w3m buffer.  This is usually the next
     buffer to the right in the tabs line.  If called with a numeric
     argument N, move N buffers to the next (`w3m-next-buffer').

   If you are a GNU Emacs user, you can also move an emacs-w3m buffer to
the adjacent place on the tabs line using the following commands:

`C-c C-.'
`C-c C->'
     Move the selected emacs-w3m buffer to the right hand adjacent
     place on the tabs line.  If called with a numeric argument N, move
     N tabs to the right (`w3m-tab-move-right').

`C-c C-,'
`C-c C-<'
     Move the selected emacs-w3m buffer to the left hand adjacent place
     on the tabs line.  If called with a numeric argument N, move N
     tabs to the left (`w3m-tab-move-left').

   Also note that if these commands don't fit you well despite our
efforts, you might find what you need in "generalist" buffer management
packages such as ibuffer or iswitchb--since emacs-w3m buffers are
regular Emacs buffers, they will work fine too.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) You can use `C-u 2 C-c C-n' instead of `2 C-c C-n' as usual.  But
keep in mind all numeric keys and minus-sign are assigned to the numeric
prefix arguments in emacs-w3m buffers.


File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Selecting buffers,  Prev: Moving across buffers,  Up: Working with buffers

3.6.3 Selecting buffers from a list
-----------------------------------

There are two ways to select emacs-w3m buffers from a list.  The first
one is a minibuffer-based interface, called with `C-c C-a'.  You can
choose the buffer you want to display using the `M-p' and `M-n' keys
(or the <up> and <down> arrow keys), they will make you cycle through
the list.  You can also edit the prompt and type the title of an
existing web page, using `<TAB>' for completion.  For example, if you
have a "Google Search" page opened, you can type "Goo" then hit `<TAB>'
and the page title will be completed.  After the page name, the buffer
name is given (between brackets).  Then use `<RET>' to switch to the
buffer you have chosen.

   The second and more sophisticated interface is called the emacs-w3m
buffer list, it is invoked with `C-c C-s'.  It shows you the list of
all opened buffers in a separate window (either a vertical or a
horizontal window--`C-c C-s' toggles between the two modes) and allows
you to view the buffers in real-time: when you move the point in the
buffer list, the buffer under point is displayed in the main window,
which allows you to have direct visual feedback of the buffer you're
switching to.

   To move in the buffer list, you can use the `p' and `n' keys (or the
arrow keys).  In the buffer list, `<DEL>' and `<SPC>' allow you to
scroll the buffer displayed in the main window, which is handy if you
want to check that you're seeing the right buffer.  To select the
buffer under point, you can use the `<RET>' key, in which case the
buffer list will be buried, or the `w' key, in which case the buffer
list will remain visible and the focus given to the main window.

   You can also close and create buffers from this menu, using the same
bindings as the one used in regular buffers (*note Creating and killing
buffers::).

   Finally, the `?' key shows a short help, `g' refreshes the list and
the `q' key exits the buffer list, not changing the active buffer.

`C-c C-a'
     Prompt for a buffer name in the minibuffer.  `M-p' and `M-n' cycle
     through the list of existing buffers and `<TAB>' completes
     (`w3m-switch-buffer').

`C-c C-s'
     Show the buffer list in a separate window (`w3m-select-buffer').
     In this window, `C-c C-s' toggles between horizontal and vertical
     modes, `<RET>' selects the buffer under point and buries the
     buffer list, `w' selects the buffer under point and gives it the
     focus, `n', `p' and the arrow keys can be used to move down or up.


File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Downloading,  Next: Submitting Forms,  Prev: Working with buffers,  Up: Basic Usage

3.7 Downloading a file
======================

It is possible to download (i.e. fetch, but not display) any web page or
file with emacs-w3m: just put the point on the link you want to
download and hit `d'.  You will be prompted for a filename under which
to save the file locally, by default it will be the name of the file on
the remote server.  Confirm with `<RET>'.  The download will be
asynchronous and not block your Emacs session, you can continue your
emacs-w3m browsing in another buffer if you want.

   Please note that this download mechanism uses w3m to download things,
you might want to use the more powerful wget downloader instead.  Have a
look at our friend project "emacs-wget", its homepage is at
`http://pop-club.hp.infoseek.co.jp/emacs/emacs-wget/'.

`d' (Lynx-like keymap)
`D' (Info-like keymap)
     Download the file or the page pointed to by the link under point
     (`w3m-download-this-url').

`M-d' (Lynx-like keymap)
`d' (Info-like keymap)
     Download the contents of URL to a local file (`w3m-download').  You
     will be prompted for the URL and the name of a local file.


File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Submitting Forms,  Next: HTML File Information,  Prev: Downloading,  Up: Basic Usage

3.8 Filling in HTML forms
=========================

These emacs-w3m commands let you move between forms and fill in fields,
using simple key bindings and optionally prompting you for values in
Emacs windows or in the minibuffer.

   The main key binding to remember is `<RET>'.  It has different
meanings, depending on the thing under point: for textareas, you will be
prompted for a value in the minibuffer.  For select tags, you will be
given a list of choices in an electric Emacs window (you can move using
the arrow keys, and pick one with the `<RET>' key).  For radio and
checkbox buttons, the `<RET>' key selects one of the elements.

   When in the minibuffer or in the electric window, you can cancel with
the `C-c C-q' sequence.  To submit the form, use `C-c C-c'.

`]'
     Jump to the next form (`w3m-next-form').

`['
     Jump to the previous form (`w3m-previous-form').

`C-c C-c'
     Submit form at point (`w3m-submit-form').

`<RET>'
     Edit the value of the form item under point.

`<RET>' (w3m-form-*-keymap)
     Accept the value.

`C-c C-q' (w3m-form-*-keymap)
     Quit editing the form item, leaving changes.

   Unless `w3m-form-use-textarea-backup' is set to `nil', emacs-w3m
stores the text you input in textareas in backup files for later reuse.
When you start editing a form and there is backup text available, you
will be asked whether you want to use it or not.  Files to save text
are stored in the directory specified by the
`w3m-form-textarea-directory' variable.

3.9 Support for web page editing and hacking
============================================

For those who usually use Emacs to write documentation or programs, it's
very convenient to be able to browse the web in the same Emacs session.
For example, if you are editing a HTML file in Emacs, you can preview it
without launching an external browser.  You can also quickly copy sample
code from technical documentation during a programming marathon...

   How about the opposite?  (That is, being able to edit the source of a
web page in a web browser.)  Wouldn't that be cool?  Imagine you found
an error in your document after previewing it in emacs-w3m; you probably
want to fix it right away.  Or if you are a programmer specialized in
web technology, sometimes you might want to see the raw HTML file for
the current web page... especially if you are the author of a Shimbun
module (*note Shimbun Basics::).

   It is usually possible to switch to an Emacs buffer visiting an HTML
file by using the buffer name, but emacs-w3m adds a specific keybinding
for this.  Emacs-w3m knows the URL of the web page it is visiting, so
why not take advantage of this?

`\'
     Display the current web page in the raw HTML
     format(`w3m-view-source').

`='
     Show the information about currently displayed web page. It
     includes title, URL, document type, last modified
     date(`w3m-view-header').

`E' (Lynx-like keymap)
`e' (Info-like keymap)
     Edit the local file pointed by URL of current
     page(`w3m-edit-current-url').

`e' (Lynx-like keymap)
`E' (Info-like keymap)
     Edit the local file pointed by URL under
     point(`w3m-edit-this-url').

`M'
     Launch an external browser (other than emacs-w3m) and display the
     same web page as currently displayed in
     emacs-w3m(`w3m-view-url-with-external-browser').  The external
     browser to be used is defined by the variable
     `w3m-content-type-alist', depending on the kind of URL.

`|'
     Pipe the source of the web page to a command.  You will be
     prompted for the command (`w3m-pipe-source').

   The (*note Tips::) section gives more examples on how to integrate
emacs-w3m with other commands and Emacs subsystems.

4.1 Convenient ways to search the web
=====================================

Emacs-w3m comes with advanced features related to search engines, they
are accessible through three interfaces:

   * The regular search interface, invoked by the `S' key (the `s' key
     for the `Info-like' keymap) in any emacs-w3m buffer.  It is a
     simple interactive way to choose which search engine to use and
     input a search term; see *note The Search Interface::.

   * The Quicksearch interface: it is a faster (yet more complicated)
     way to use search engines, by going to specially crafted URLs.
     For more information about this feature, see *note Quick
     Searching::.

   * The "I'm feeling lucky" feature: if it's enabled
     (`w3m-enable-google-feeling-lucky'), entering words instead of a
     regular URL at the URL prompt will begin a Google search for the
     words automatically, and display the most relevant result.  This
     is useful if you actually want to fetch the most relevant page, it
     does not display a list of search results.

File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: The Search Interface,  Next: Quick Searching,  Up: Using Search Engines

4.1.1 How to search with emacs-w3m
----------------------------------

You can fire up the regular search interface by using the `S' key (the
`s' key for the `Info-like' keymap) in an emacs-w3m buffer.  You will
see a prompt in the minibuffer, asking for a search term.  Type one or
several words at the prompt, then hit `<RET>'.  The result page of your
search in the engine appears, you can then browse the results, just as
if you had used the normal web based entry point to the engine.

   You probably noticed that you have not been given a chance to choose
which engine you want to search with.  By default, emacs-w3m will use
the Google search engine, you can change this behavior by customizing
the `w3m-search-default-engine' variable (see *note Customizable
Variables::), or you can specify the search engine each time you use the
command.

   To specify which engine to use, you have to give the command a prefix
argument (usually, this means hitting `C-u' before the command, e.g.
`C-u S' (`C-u s' for the `Info-like' keymap).  Emacs-w3m will prompt
you for an engine, you can choose one by typing its name (completion is
also available with the `<TAB>' key).  Once you have made your choice,
hit the `<RET>' key.  You can then type your search term, hit `<RET>',
and you will see the search results.

`S' (Lynx-like keymap)
`s' (Info-like keymap)
     Begin a new search.  If called with a prefix argument, prompt for
     the engine to use (`w3m-search').

If you're a "Web Power User" (and since you're reading this, you
probably are), you need a quick and efficient way to perform searches.
The Quick Searching feature is one.

   What does it do?  It lets you launch web searches by simply going to
a special URL such as `gg:emacs'.  The advantages of this mode of
operation are:

   * It's fast.  You just have to type a URL to choose the engine and
     the search word(s), in one go.

   * It's convenient.  With this feature, you can easily open a new
     emacs-w3m tab or window, and launch a search in it, using for
     example, the `G' key to open a URL in a new window, and going to a
     Quicksearch URL.  You can also bookmark searches just by
     bookmarking the special Quicksearch URL.

   * It works with the grouping feature.  You can launch two searches
     at the same time, with a URL like `group:gg:emacs&ya:w3m'.  This
     would for instance launch a search for "emacs" on Google and for
     "w3m" on Yahoo!.  *Note Grouping URLs::.

   Using it is very simple: suppose you want to search for the word
"gnu" on Google and get a list of results.  Hit `g' to go to a new URL,
and type "gg:gnu".  The first part of this expression, "gg" indicates
that we want to use the Google search engine.  The second term is the
word we will be searching for.  The prefix and the search term must be
separated by a colon.  Hit `<RET>', and you will see the results of
your search.  Note that you can input several words by separating them
with spaces.  `<SPC>' is a self-inserting key in the minibuffer if the
"Feeling Lucky" feature is enabled (it is by default; see
`w3m-enable-google-feeling-lucky').  If it's disabled, then hit `C-q'
first, i.e. `C-q <SPC>'.

   The default configuration of emacs-w3m includes several prefixes you
can use, they are defined in the `w3m-uri-replace-alist' variable.
There's for example "gg" for Google, "ggg" for Google Groups, "ya" for
Yahoo!, "al" for Altavista, "alc" for Eijirou on the web to name a few.
You can also add prefixes for the search engines you define, *Note
Adding New Search Engines::.

   Instead of prefixes, you can also use full engine names in
Quicksearch URLs, such as "google" or "yahoo".  These names are defined
in the `w3m-search-engine-alist' variable.

4.1.3 Using your favorite engines
---------------------------------

Emacs-w3m has a number of built-in search engines you can use.  What if
you want to use your favorite search engine and it's not listed in the
known search engines?  You have to add it to the list of search
engines, and it's quite easy:

  1. First, you have to find what's the entry point of the search
     engine you want to add, for example:

     `http://my.searchengine.com/?query=foobar'

     where foobar is the term you want to search for.

  2. Once you have this information, add this to your `~/.emacs-w3m'
     file:

          (eval-after-load "w3m-search"
            '(add-to-list 'w3m-search-engine-alist
                          '("My engine"
                            "http://my.searchengine.com/?query=%s"
                            nil)))

     Replace the first field "My engine" with the description of your
     engine, the second field with the entry point (the `%s' is
     important, it will be replaced by the search term when you issue
     the search), and the third field is the encoding to use, `nil' or
     omitting this field means to use the value of
     `w3m-default-coding-system' as a regular encoding.

     For English search engines, you rarely have to worry about this.
     However, for some Japanese search engines, you may need to specify
     something (e.g. `euc-japan') there.

  3. You can now use this engine to search, using the normal `S' key
     (the `s' key for the `Info-like' keymap) in emacs-w3m.  If you use
     this engine often, you can also add it to the Quicksearch (see
     *note Quick Searching::) engines and give it a small prefix, by
     adding this to your `~/.emacs-w3m' file instead:

          (eval-after-load "w3m-search"
            '(progn
               (add-to-list 'w3m-search-engine-alist
                            '("My engine"
                              "http://my.searchengine.com/?query=%s"
                              nil))
               (add-to-list 'w3m-uri-replace-alist
                            '("\\`my:" w3m-search-uri-replace "My engine"))))

     This way you can also use a URL like `my:foobar' to search for the
     term "foobar" with your engine.

4.2 Visiting several web pages in one URL
=========================================

Emacs-w3m can manipulate "group URLs": special URLs that contain
several real URLs.  When you open these group URLs, emacs-w3m will open
one buffer for each URL in the group, allowing you to open several pages
in one go.

   To build group URLs, you just have to put together (i.e. concatenate)
all the addresses you want to open, separating them with the ampersand
symbol (that's "&"), and prefixing the grouped URLs with "group:".  For
example, suppose you want to visit the GNU Project's homepage,
`http://www.gnu.org/', and the Savannah homepage,
`http://savannah.nongnu.org/': the group URL would be

   `group:http://www.gnu.org/&http://savannah.nongnu.org/'

   Since this syntax can be quite hard to use on a daily basis, this
feature will be most useful when used with very short URLs (Quicksearch
URLs for example, see *note Quick Searching::); or in non-interactive
contexts.

4.4 Raise your antenna
======================

Antenna is a tool to keep track of changes in web pages.  Using Antenna,
you can periodically check if particular pages have been updated, and if
they haven't, know the last time you saw them.

   You can start Antenna using the `A' key in any emacs-w3m buffer.
Alternatively, you can go to the special URL `about://antenna/'; it
does the same thing.

4.4.1 How to add your web sites to Antenna
------------------------------------------

If you want to add the visiting web site to Antenna, type the `+' key.
You will be taken to the customization buffer of `w3m-antenna-sites',
with all fields already set up for you.  You just have to hit the
buttons "Save for future sessions" and "Finish".

`+'
     Add a URL to the Antenna database.  If called with a prefix
     argument, ask for a URL instead of adding the current page
     (`w3m-antenna-add-current-url').


File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Daily web tracking,  Prev: Setting up Antenna,  Up: Using Antenna

4.4.2 Tracking changes with Antenna
-----------------------------------

On the Antenna page, you will see two sections: one called "Updated"
and another called "Visited".  In the "Updated" section, you will find
websites which have changed since the last Antenna update, and in the
"Visited" section, the websites which haven't.  In each section, each
line stands for one website of the Antenna database, and has the
following structure:

   `  * 2002/12/15 16:43  (T)  My website'

   The first part is the last time the website was updated, or if this
information is not available, the last time Antenna noticed a change in
this page.

   The `(T)' stands for "Time", it means that the change was detected
because the last modification time of that page has changed since the
last Antenna update.  Another possible value here is `S' (for "Size"),
which means that the change has been detected because the size of the
page has changed.

   The last part of this line is the title you gave to this website when
you added it to the database.

   Please note that the Antenna database doesn't get automatically
updated, you have to update it each time you want to check if the sites
have changed, either by hitting `R' in the Antenna page, or by passing a
prefix argument to the command (start Antenna with `C-u A', for
example).

   If you want to make the Antenna database get updated automatically,
set the value of the `w3m-antenna-refresh-interval' variable to a
positive integer which is an interval time in seconds.

`A'
     Visit the Antenna page.  If called with a prefix argument, update
     the Antenna database before displaying it (`w3m-antenna').

4.5 Showing the tree structure of local directories
===================================================

Using the `w3m-dtree' command, you can display a tree of all
subdirectories of a local directory, and browse it like a regular web
page.  The emacs-w3m buffer you get when you use this feature is very
similar to the output of the external "tree" utility, hence the name.
Emacs-w3m adds a bonus: if you call the command with a prefix argument,
it will display files as well, turning emacs-w3m into a full-featured
file browser.

   Here is an example of what an emacs-w3m dtree run looks like:

     /home/romain/.elisp/emacs-w3m/
      |-CVS/
      |-attic/
      |  +-CVS/
      |-autom4te.cache/
      |-doc/
      |  |-CVS/
      |  +-emacs-w3m/
      |-icons/
      |  +-CVS/
      |-patches/
      |  +-CVS/
      +-shimbun/
         +-CVS/

   And with a prefix argument, you get something like this instead:

     /home/romain/.elisp/emacs-w3m/ (allfiles)
      |-(f).cvsignore
      |-(f)BUGS.ja
      |-(f)COPYING
      |-[d]CVS/
      |  |-(f)Entries
      |  |-(f)Repository
      |  +-(f)Root
      |-(f)ChangeLog
      |-(f)ChangeLog.1
      |-(f)Makefile
      |-(f)Makefile.in
      |-(f)README
      |-(f)README.ja

`D' (Lynx-like keymap)
`T' (Info-like keymap)
     Prompt for a local directory in the minibuffer, then display its
     tree structure.  If called with a prefix argument (e.g. `C-u D', or
     `C-u T' for the `Info-like' keymap), show files in the directories
     as well (`w3m-dtree').

4.9 Grouping sessions into separate frames
==========================================

It is possible to manage groups of emacs-w3m sessions in separate
frames.  One use for this would be to have two emacs-w3m frames, where
one contains sessions visiting search engines, and the other sessions
visiting news sites.

   Emacs-w3m offers some convenient features that allow you to visit
many web pages at the same time.  For instance, you can use tabs (*note
Using Tabs::) to visit many pages in new sessions, or do so using a
special URL beginning with `group:' (*note Grouping URLs::).  However,
you may want to group them into separate frames if there are too many
pages.  If so, the `w3m-fb-mode' command is for you.  Note that you
have to set the `w3m-use-tab' variable to non-`nil' (`t' by default)
and set the `w3m-pop-up-frames' variable to `nil' (the default) in
order to use it (*note General Variables::).

   Typing `M-x w3m-fb-mode' toggles the mode, but you can turn the mode
on by giving a positive integer as a prefix argument to the command
(zero or less turns it off).

   When the `w3m-fb-mode' is turned on, the sessions that you start in
the current frame will be associated with only that frame.  Other
sessions that are opened in other frames will similarly only appear in
those frames.  In other words, sessions associated with one frame don't
appear in other frames.  `w3m-fb-mode' doesn't create any new frames,
so you need to make them yourself in some way.


File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Session Manager,  Prev: Frame Local Buffers,  Up: Pretty Good Features

4.10 Saving and loading sessions
================================

It is possible to save and load the emacs-w3m sessions sets.

   You can save the set of the currently opened sessions for the future
use.  Just hit `M-S' and name the set.

   Then you will ask how to take the saved sessions set back, won't you?
Hit `M-s' to open the sessions selection menu.  The available command
keys include:

`<RET>'
     Open all the sessions of the selected sessions set.

`M-s'
     Open the detail menu for the selected sessions set.  You can open
     the sessions one by one in that menu.

`d'
     Delete the selected sessions set or the session.

`r'
     Rename the selected sessions set.

`s'
     Save all the opened sessions.  So does `M-S'.

`n'
     Move the cursor to the next sessions set.

`p'
     Move the cursor to the previous sessions set.

`q'
     Quit the sessions selection menu.

   Emacs-w3m saves some sessions automatically.  If
`w3m-session-deleted-save' is non-`nil', emacs-w3m saves the closed
sessions automatically.  This would be helpful for recovering a session
that has been closed inadvertently.  If `w3m-session-automatic-save' is
non-`nil', emacs-w3m saves the opened sessions automatically when
quitting emacs-w3m.

   Sometimes you might forget the URLs of the pages you viewed with the
interest.  Of course emacs-w3m helps you even in such a case.  If
`w3m-session-load-last-sessions' is non-`nil', emacs-w3m automatically
opens the sessions set viewed last.  If it is `ask', you will be asked
whether to take the set back (default `nil').

   You may have had a bad experience with a crash. It makes you
disappointing, and makes displayed web pages lost. Emacs-w3m helps you
also in such a case. If `w3m-session-crash-recovery' is non-`nil',
emacs-w3m saves displayed sessions set to use for crash recovering
automatically and recovers saved sessions when emacs-w3m (or emacs,
etc) crashes (default `t'). If `w3m-session-load-crashed-sessions' is
non-`nil', emacs-w3m automatically recovers the crashed sessions set.
If it is `ask', you will be asked whether to recover the set (default
`ask').


File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Customizable Variables,  Next: Hooking into MUAs,  Prev: Pretty Good Features,  Up: Top

5 Customizable variables
************************

A lot of emacs-w3m variables are customizable via the Custom mechanism,
a graphical Emacs interface to define user options.  Custom offers
several methods to define your customizations, you can use for example
`M-x customize-option' for a single option (i.e. an Emacs Lisp
variable) or `M-x customize-group' to see all available options
(including variables and faces) for a "group" and change them; in which
case the group to use is `w3m'.

   Alternatively (if you don't want to use Custom), you can put
arbitrary Emacs Lisp expressions in your emacs-w3m initialization file,
which is `~/.emacs-w3m' by default.  This example:

     (setq w3m-home-page "http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/")

would set the default homepage to `http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/'.  The
syntax to use is the same as in your `~/.emacs' file.  *Note Init File:
(emacs)Init File.

   Please note that some variables from external modules could be
undefined at the time the `~/.emacs-w3m' file is loaded, thus making
them impossible to modify (of course if you don't care about the default
value, you can override them completely in your `~/.emacs-w3m') file.
The `w3m-search-engine-alist' variable is a typical example (*note
Search Variables::).

`w3m-init-file'
     When emacs-w3m starts, it will read the `w3m-init-file' file.  The
     default value is `~/.emacs-w3m'.  You probably don't need to change
     this.  This is a normal Emacs Lisp file and can be used to avoid
     cluttering your `~/.emacs' and `site-init' files with emacs-w3m
     stuff.  Emacs-w3m will also check for files with the same names as
     this, but with `.elc' and `.el' extensions (in other words,
     `~/.emacs-w3m.elc', `~/.emacs-w3m.el' and `~/.emacs-w3m', in this
     order).

File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: General Variables,  Next: Image Variables,  Up: Customizable Variables

5.1 General variables
=====================

`w3m-accept-languages'
     List of acceptable languages in descending order of priority.  The
     default value is set according to the `accept_language' entry of
     the `w3m' configuration file (normally `~/.w3m/config').

`w3m-add-referer'
     Rule of sending referers.  There are five choices as the valid
     values of this option.

       1. `nil': this means that emacs-w3m never send referers.

       2. `t': this means that emacs-w3m always send referers.

       3. `lambda': this means that emacs-w3m send referers only when
          both the current page and the target page are provided by the
          same server.

       4. a cons cell keeping two regular expressions: this means that
          emacs-w3m send referers when the url of the current page
          matches the first regular expression and does not match the
          second regular expression.  `Nil' for the regexp matches any
          url.

       5. a function: emacs-w3m send referers when this function which
          has two arguments, URL and REFERER, returns non-`nil'.

     If you're nervous about leaking private WEB browsing history
     information, set this option to `nil' or `lambda'.  If your
     computer belongs to a secret network, you may set a pair of
     regular expressions to inhibit sending referers which will
     disclose your private information, as follows:

          (setq w3m-add-referer
                '("\\`http:\"
                  . "\\`http://\\([^./]+\\.\\)*example\\.net/"))

`w3m-add-user-agent'
     Non-`nil' means add the User-Agent field to the request header.
     The value of `w3m-user-agent' is used for the field body.

`w3m-arrived-file'
     Name of the file to keep the arrived URLs database.

`w3m-auto-show'
     Non-`nil' means provide the ability to horizontally scroll the
     window.  Automatic horizontal scrolling happens when the point
     gets away from both ends of the window, but nothing occurs if
     `truncate-lines' is set to `nil'.

     This feature works with specific emacs-w3m code; usual
     `auto-hscroll-mode', `automatic-hscrolling', `auto-show-mode' or
     `hscroll-mode' will all be invalidated in emacs-w3m buffers.

`w3m-charset-coding-system-alist'
     Alist of MIME charsets and coding systems.  Both charsets and
     coding systems must be symbols.

`w3m-coding-system'
     Default coding system used to communicate with the `w3m' command.

`w3m-coding-system-priority-list'
     Coding systems in order of priority used for emacs-w3m sessions.

`w3m-command'
     Name of the executable file of the `w3m' command.  You normally
     don't have to specify the value, since emacs-w3m looks for the
     existing commands `w3m', `w3mmee' and `w3m-m17n' (in this order)
     in the `exec-path' directories in order if it is `nil' in the
     beginning.

     If you want to use the other `w3m' command, specify the value of
     this variable explicitly in the .emacs file or customize the value
     and save it.  In this case, you need to restart Emacs and
     emacs-w3m: there is currently no way to apply the changing of the
     `w3m' command to all the emacs-w3m programs safely after loading
     the `w3m.elc' module.

`w3m-command-arguments'
     List of the default arguments passed to the `w3m' command.  See
     also `w3m-command-arguments-alist'.

`w3m-command-arguments-alist'
     Alist of regexps matching urls and additional arguments passed to
     `w3m'.  A typical usage of this variable is to specify whether to
     use a proxy server for particular hosts.  The first match made
     will be used.  Here is an example of how to set this variable:

          (setq w3m-command-arguments-alist
                '(;; Don't use the proxy server to visit local web pages.
                  ("^http://\\([^/]*\\.\\)*your-company\\.com\\(/\\|$\\)"
                   "-no-proxy")
                  ;; Use the proxy server to visit any foreign urls.
                  (""
                   "-o" "http_proxy=http://proxy.your-company.com:8080/")))

     Here the first element matches any url where the scheme is `http'
     and the hostname is either `your-company.com' or a name ending with
     `.your-company.com'; the proxy server is not used for those hosts.
     If you are a regexp novice, you can use the `w3m-no-proxy-domains'
     variable instead.

`w3m-command-environment'
     Alist of environment variables for subprocesses to inherit.

`w3m-confirm-leaving-secure-page'
     If non-`nil', you'll be asked for confirmation when leaving secure
     pages.  It is STRONGLY recommended to set a non-nil value to this
     option.  You MUST understand what you want to do completely before
     switching off this option.  The default value is `t'.

`w3m-content-type-alist'
     Alist of content types, regexps, commands to view, and filters.
     Each element is a list which consists of the following data:

       1. Content type.

       2. Regexp matching a url or a file name.

       3. Method to view contents.  The following three types may be
          used:

            a. Lisp function which takes the url to view as an argument.

            b. ("COMMAND" [ARG...]) - where "COMMAND" is the external
               command and ARG's are the arguments passed to the command
               if any.  The symbols `file' and `url' that appear in
               ARG's will be replaced respectively with the name of a
               temporary file which contains the contents and the
               string of the url to view.

            c. `nil' which means to download the url into the local
               file.

       4. Content type that overrides the one specified by `1. Content
          type'.  Valid values include:

            a. Lisp function that takes three arguments URL,
               CONTENT-TYPE, and CHARSET, and returns a content type.

            b. String that specifies a content type.

            c. `nil' that means not to override the content type.

`w3m-correct-charset-alist'
     Alist of MIME charsets; strange ones and standard ones.

`w3m-db-history-display-size'
     Maximum number of arrived URLs which are displayed per page.

`w3m-decoder-alist'
     Alist of encoding types, decoder commands, and arguments.

`w3m-default-coding-system'
     Default coding system used to encode url strings and post-data.

`w3m-default-content-type'
     Default value assumed as the content type of local files.

`w3m-default-directory'
     Directory used as the current directory in emacs-w3m buffers.  The
     valid values include a string specifying an existing directory, a
     symbol of which the value specifies an existing directory, a
     function which takes a url as an argument and returns a directory,
     and `nil' (which is the default).  If the specified directory does
     not exist or it is `nil', the value of `w3m-profile-directory' is
     used.

     Note that there is an exception: if a page visits a local file or
     visits a remote file using ftp, the directory in which the file
     exists is used as the current directory instead.

`w3m-default-save-directory'
     Default directory where downloaded files will be saved to.

`w3m-delete-duplicated-empty-lines'
     Non-`nil' means display two or more continuous empty lines into
     single.

`w3m-dirlist-cgi-program'
     Name of the CGI program to list a local directory.  If it is
     `nil', the dirlist.cgi module of the `w3m' command will be used.

`w3m-doc-view-content-types'
     List of content types for which to use `doc-view-mode' to view
     contents.  This overrides `w3m-content-type-alist'.

`w3m-edit-function'
     Function used for editing local files.  It is used when the
     `w3m-edit-current-url' command or the `w3m-edit-this-url' command
     is invoked.

`w3m-edit-function-alist'
     Alist of functions used for editing pages.  This option is
     referred to decide which function should be used to edit a
     specified page, when either `w3m-edit-current-url' or
     `w3m-edit-this-url' is invoked.  When no suitable function is
     found from this alist, `w3m-edit-function' is used.

`w3m-enable-google-feeling-lucky'
     Non-`nil' enables you to enter any words as well as a url when
     prompted.  In that case, emacs-w3m uses Google to search for the
     words.  The default value is `t'.

`w3m-encoding-type-alist'
     Alist of file suffixes and content encoding types.

`w3m-file-coding-system'
     Coding system used when writing configuration files.  This value
     will be referred to by the `w3m-save-list' function.

`w3m-file-name-coding-system'
     Coding system used to convert pathnames when emacs-w3m accesses
     files.

`w3m-fill-column'
     Integer used as the value for `fill-column' in emacs-w3m buffers.
     If it is positive, pages will be displayed within the columns of
     that number.  If it is zero or negative, the number of columns
     which subtracted that number from the window width is applied to
     the maximum width of pages.  Note that XEmacs does not always obey
     this setting.

`w3m-follow-redirection'
     Maximum number of redirections which emacs-w3m honors and follows.
     If `nil', redirections are followed by the `w3m' command.  Don't
     set it to `nil' if you allow to use cookies (i.e., you have set
     `w3m-use-cookies' to non-`nil') since cookies may be shared among
     many redirected pages.

`w3m-home-page'
     This variable specifies the url string to open when emacs-w3m
     starts.  Don't say HP, it's the abbreviated name of a certain
     company. ;-)

`w3m-horizontal-scroll-columns'
     Number of steps in columns used when scrolling a window
     horizontally.

`w3m-horizontal-scroll-division'
     Integer used by the program making the point certainly visible.
     The cursor definitely does not go missing even when it has been
     driven out of the window while wandering around anchors and forms
     in an emacs-w3m buffer.

     Suppose that the value of this variable is N.  When the point is
     outside the left of the window, emacs-w3m scrolls the window so
     that the point may be displayed on the position within 1/N of the
     width of the window from the left.  Similarly, when the point is
     outside the right of the window, emacs-w3m scrolls the window so
     that the point may be displayed on the position of 1/N of the
     width of the window from the right.

     This feature doesn't work if `w3m-auto-show' is `nil'.  The value
     must be a larger integer than 1.

`w3m-horizontal-shift-columns'
     Number of steps in columns used when shifting a window
     horizontally.  The term `shifting' means a fine level scrolling.

`w3m-imitate-widget-button'
     If non-`nil', imitate the widget buttons on link (anchor) buttons.
     It is useful for moving about in a Gnus article buffer using
     `<TAB>' key.  It can also be any Lisp form that should return a
     boolean value.

`w3m-init-file'
     Your emacs-w3m startup file name.  If a file with the `.el' or
     `.elc' suffixes exists, it will be read instead.

     Note: This file is used as the startup configuration _NOT_ for the
     `w3m' command but for emacs-w3m.  In order to modify configurations
     for the `w3m' command, edit the file named `~/.w3m/config'
     normally.

`w3m-input-coding-system'
     Coding system used when writing to `w3m' processes.  It overrides
     `coding-system-for-write' if it is not `binary'.  Otherwise, the
     value of the `w3m-current-coding-system' variable is used instead.

`w3m-keep-arrived-urls'
     Maximum number of URLs which the arrived URLs database keeps.

`w3m-keep-cache-size'
     Maximum number of pages to be cached in emacs-w3m.

`w3m-key-binding'
     Type of key binding set used in emacs-w3m sessions.  The valid
     values include `info' which provides `Info-like' keys, and `nil'
     which provides `Lynx-like' keys.

`w3m-language'
     Your preferred language used in emacs-w3m sessions.

`w3m-local-directory-view-method'
     Symbol of the method to view a local directory tree.  The valid
     values include `w3m-cgi' using the CGI program specified by the
     `w3m-dirlist-cgi-program' variable (which see), and `w3m-dtree'
     using the w3m-dtree Lisp module.

`w3m-local-find-file-function'
     Function used to open local files.  If a url of the `file:' scheme
     in which you entered agrees with the rule of the
     `w3m-local-find-file-regexps' variable (which see), it is used to
     open the file.

     Function should take one argument, the string naming the local
     file.  It can also be any Lisp form returning a function.  Set
     this to `nil' if you want to always use emacs-w3m to see local
     files.

`w3m-local-find-file-regexps'
     `Cons' of two regexps matching and not matching with local file
     names.  If a url of the `file:' scheme in which you entered matches
     the first form and does not match the latter form, it will be
     opened by the function specified by the
     `w3m-local-find-file-function' variable.  `Nil' for the regexp
     matches any file names.

     For instance, the value `(nil . "\\.html?\\'")' allows
     `file:///some/where/w3m.el', not `file:///any/where/index.html',
     to open by the function specified by
     `w3m-local-find-file-function'.  The latter will be opened as a
     normal web page.  Furthermore, if you would like to view some
     types of contents in the local system using the viewers specified
     by the `w3m-content-type-alist' variable, you can add regexps
     matching those file names to the second element of this variable.
     For example:

          (setq w3m-local-find-file-regexps
                '(nil . "\\.\\(?:[sx]?html?\\|dvi\\|ps\\|pdf\\)\\'"))

     It is effective only when the `w3m-local-find-file-function'
     variable is set properly.

`w3m-mailto-url-function'
     Function used to handle the `mailto' urls.  Function is called with
     one argument, just a url.  If it is `nil', a function specified by
     the `mail-user-agent' variable will be used for composing mail
     messages.

`w3m-mailto-url-popup-function-alist'
     Alist of `(MAJOR-MODE . FUNCTION)' pairs used to pop a mail buffer
     up.  If a user clicks on a `mailto' url and a mail buffer is
     composed by `mail-user-agent' with the `MAJOR-MODE', `FUNCTION'
     will be called with a mail buffer as an argument.  Note that the
     variables `special-display-buffer-names',
     `special-display-regexps', `same-window-buffer-names' and
     `same-window-regexps' will be bound to `nil' while popping to a
     buffer up.

`w3m-make-new-session'
     Non-`nil' means making new emacs-w3m buffers when visiting new
     pages.  If it is non-`nil' and there are already emacs-w3m buffers,
     the `w3m' command makes a new emacs-w3m buffer if a user specifies
     a url string in the minibuffer, and the `w3m-safe-view-this-url'
     command also makes a new buffer if a user invokes it in a buffer
     not being running the `w3m-mode'.  The default value is `nil'.

`w3m-mbconv-command'
     Name of the `mbconv' command provided by the `libmoe' package.
     The `libmoe' package is used when you use the `w3mmee' command
     instead of the `w3m' command.  See also `w3m-command'.

`w3m-no-proxy-domains'
     List of domain names for which emacs-w3m will not use a proxy
     server.  Each element should be exactly a domain name which means
     the latter common part of the host names, not a regexp.

`w3m-output-coding-system'
     Coding system used when reading from `w3m' processes.

`w3m-pop-up-frames'
     Non-`nil' means pop to a new frame up for an emacs-w3m session.
     This variable is similar to `pop-up-frames' and does override
     `w3m-pop-up-windows'.  If `w3m-use-tab' is non-`nil' or there is
     the buffers selection window (for the `w3m-select-buffer'
     feature), this variable is ignored when creating the second or more
     emacs-w3m session.

`w3m-pop-up-windows'
     Non-`nil' means split the windows when a new emacs-w3m session is
     created.  This variable is similar to `pop-up-windows' and quite
     overridden by `w3m-pop-up-frames' as if `pop-up-frames'
     influences.  Furthermore, if `w3m-use-tab' is non-`nil' or there
     is the buffers selection window (for the `w3m-select-buffer'
     feature), this variable is ignored when creating the second or more
     emacs-w3m session.

`w3m-popup-frame-parameters'
     Alist of frame parameters used when creating a new emacs-w3m
     frame.  It allows not only the alist form but also XEmacs' plist
     form.

`w3m-prefer-cache'
     Non-`nil' means that cached contents are used without checking
     headers.

`w3m-profile-directory'
     Directory where emacs-w3m config files are loaded from or saved to.

`w3m-quick-start'
     Non-`nil' means let emacs-w3m start quickly w/o requiring
     confirmation.  When you invoke the `w3m' command, it attempts to
     visit the page of a string like url around the cursor or the value
     of `w3m-home-page'.  You won't be asked for the confirmation then
     if this value is non-`nil'.  Otherwise, you will be prompted for
     that url with the editing form.

`w3m-redirect-with-get'
     If non-`nil', use the GET method after redirection.  It controls
     how emacs-w3m works when a server responds the code 301 or 302.
     Here is an extract from RFC2616:

     Note: RFC 1945 and RFC 2068 specify that the client is not allowed
     to change the method on the redirected request.  However, most
     existing user agent implementations treat 302 as if it were a 303
     response, performing a GET on the Location field-value regardless
     of the original request method.

`w3m-relationship-estimate-rules'
     Rules to estimate relationships between a retrieved page and
     others.

`w3m-select-buffer-horizontal-window'
     Non-`nil' means split windows horizontally to open the selection
     window.

`w3m-select-buffer-window-ratio'
     The percentage of the selection window to the whole frame.  The
     car is used when splitting windows horizontally and the cdr is for
     splitting windows vertically.

`w3m-show-decoded-url'
     Non-`nil' means show decoded URIs in the echo area, the balloon,
     etc.  This variable can take one of the following five kinds of
     forms:

       1. t

          Decode URIs using the encoding guessed from the value of
          `w3m-coding-system-priority-list'.

       2. Coding system

          Decode URIs using this value.

       3. List of coding systems

          Decode URIs using the encoding assumed based on this list.

       4. Alist of predicates and forms described below:

          Each element looks like the `(PREDICATE . ENCODING)' form.
          `PREDICATE' should be a regexp, a function or a Lisp form, and
          `ENCODING' should be one of the forms described here
          excluding this form.  If `PREDICATE' is a regexp, it will be
          tested whether it matches to the target url.  If it is a
          function, it will be called with the target url.  If it is a
          Lisp form, it will be simply evaluated.  Elements are tested
          in turn until the result of the test of the predicate is true
          and the encoding which is associated to the predicate is used
          for decoding URIs.

       5. nil

          Don't decode URIs.

`w3m-use-title-buffer-name'
     Non-`nil' means use name of buffer included current title.

`w3m-show-error-information'
     Non-`nil' means show an error information as a web page.  Page is
     made when the foreign server doesn't respond to a request to
     retrieve data.

`w3m-space-before-favicon'
     String of space char(s) to be put in front of favicon in the
     mode-line.  It may be better to use two or more spaces if you are
     using oblique or italic font in the modeline.

`w3m-space-before-modeline-icon'
     String of space character(s) to be put in front of the modeline
     icon.  It may be better to use one or more spaces if you are using
     oblique or italic font in the modeline.

`w3m-terminal-coding-system'
     Default coding system used when writing to `w3m' processes.  It is
     just a default value to set process' coding system initially.
     (This variable name is analogically derived from the behavior of
     the `w3m' command which accepts data from Emacs just like reads
     from the terminal.)

`w3m-touch-command'
     Name of the executable file of the touch command.  Note that the
     command is required to be able to modify file's timestamp with the
     `-t' option.

`w3m-track-mouse'
     Whether to track the mouse and message the url under the mouse.
     See also `show-help-function' if you are using GNU Emacs.

     A tip for XEmacs users:

     You can also use the `balloon-help' feature by the
     `M-x balloon-help-mode' command with arg 1.  If the window manager
     decorates the balloon-help frame, and that is not to your taste,
     you may strip it off with the following directives:

          For ol[v]wm use this in .Xdefaults:
             olvwm.NoDecor: balloon-help
               or
             olwm.MinimalDecor: balloon-help

          For fvwm version 1 use this in your .fvwmrc:
             NoTitle balloon-help
          or
             Style "balloon-help" NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0

          For twm use this in your .twmrc:
             NoTitle { "balloon-help" }

     See the `balloon-help.el' file for more information.

`w3m-uri-replace-alist'
     Alist of regexps matching URIs, and some types of replacements.
     It can be used universally to replace URI strings in the local
     rule to the valid forms in the Internet.

     Each element looks like the `(REGEXP FUNCTION OPTIONS...)' form.
     `FUNCTION' takes one or more arguments, a uri and `OPTIONS'.  You
     can use the grouping constructs `\\(...\\)' in `REGEXP', and they
     can be referred by the `\N' forms in a replacement (which is one
     of `OPTIONS').

     Here are some predefined functions which can be used for those
     ways:

    `w3m-pattern-uri-replace'
          Replace a URI using PATTERN (which is just an `OPTION').  It
          is allowed that PATTERN contains the `\N' forms in the same
          manner of `replace-match'.

    `w3m-search-uri-replace'
          Generate valid URLs to query words on some specified search
          engines.  For example, the element

               ("\\`gg:" w3m-search-uri-replace "google")

          makes it possible to replace the URI `gg:emacs' to a query
          for the word `emacs' on the Google search engine.

`w3m-url-local-directory-alist'
     Alist of URLs and local directories.  If directory names of a
     given URL and the car of an element are the same, emacs-w3m
     assumes that the file exists in the local directory where the cdr
     of an element points to.  The default value will be set to a value
     of the `yahtml-path-url-alist' variable which exchanged the car
     and the cdr in each element if it is available.

`w3m-use-ange-ftp'
     Non-`nil' means that `ange-ftp' or `efs' is used to access FTP
     servers.

`w3m-use-cygdrive'
     If non-`nil', use the `/cygdrive/' rule when performing
     `expand-file-name'.

`w3m-use-filter'
     Non-`nil' means use filter programs to convert web contents.  See
     also `w3m-filter-rules' (the `w3m-filter.elc' module provides it
     but might have never been loaded.  In that case, to see the default
     value and the documentation of `w3m-filter-rules', type
     `M-x load-library <RET> w3m-filter <RET>').

`w3m-use-form'
     Non-`nil' means make it possible to use form extensions.
     _(EXPERIMENTAL)_

`w3m-submit-form-safety-check'
     Non-`nil' means ask you for confirmation when submitting a form.
     The default value is `nil'.

`w3m-use-header-line'
     Non-`nil' means display the header line.

`w3m-use-header-line-title'
     Non-`nil' means display the current title at the header line. This
     variable is effective only when `w3m-use-tab' is `nil'.

`w3m-use-mule-ucs'
     Non-`nil' means use the multi-script support with Mule-UCS.

`w3m-use-refresh'
     Non-`nil' means honor the REFRESH attribute in META tags.
     Emacs-w3m arbitrarily takes you to a url specified by that
     attribute.  Note that they may be malicious traps.

`w3m-refresh-minimum-interval'
     Minimum seconds to wait for refresh, when visiting a page by
     history-back or history-next.

`w3m-use-symbol'
     Non-`nil' means replace symbols that the `<_SYMBOL>' tags lead
     into.  It is meaningful only when the `w3m-m17n' command is used
     and (X)Emacs handles unicode charsets.

`w3m-menu-on-forefront'
     Non-`nil' means place the emacs-w3m menus on the forefront of the
     menu bar.  The default value is `nil'.

`w3m-use-tab'
     Non-`nil' means make emacs-w3m a tab browser.  It makes it possible
     to show all emacs-w3m buffers in a single window with the tabs
     line, and you can choose one by clicking a mouse on it.  See also
     `w3m-use-tab-menubar'.

`w3m-use-tab-menubar'
     Non-`nil' means use the TAB pull-down menu in the menubar.  It
     makes it possible to show all emacs-w3m buffers in a single
     window, and you can choose one by clicking a mouse on it.  This
     feature requires that Emacs has been built to be able to display
     multilingual text in the menubar if you often visit web sites
     written in non-ascii text.  See also `w3m-use-tab'.

`w3m-use-toolbar'
     Non-`nil' activates toolbar of `w3m'.

`w3m-user-agent'
     String used for the User-Agent field.  See also
     `w3m-add-user-agent'.

`w3m-new-session-in-background'
     Say whether not to focus on a new tab or a new session in target.
     It influences only when a new emacs-w3m buffer is created.

`w3m-do-cleanup-temp-files'
     Non-`nil' enables emacs-w3m's auto cleanig forgotten temporary
     files feature. The default is `nil'.


File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Image Variables,  Next: Form Variables,  Prev: General Variables,  Up: Customizable Variables

5.2 Variables related to images
===============================

`w3m-default-display-inline-images'
     Non-`nil' means display images inline in emacs-w3m buffers.  You
     can toggle the visibility of images with the
     `w3m-toggle-inline-images' command.  See also
     `w3m-toggle-inline-images-permanently'.

`w3m-favicon-cache-expire-wait'
     The cache will be expired after specified seconds passed since
     retrieval.  If this variable is `nil', never expired.

`w3m-favicon-cache-file'
     Filename of saving favicon cache.  It defaults to the file named
     `.favicon' under the directory specified by the
     `w3m-profile-directory' variable.

`w3m-favicon-size'
     Size of favicon. This value is used as geometry argument for
     `convert'.

`w3m-favicon-type'
     Image type of display favicon.

`w3m-favicon-use-cache-file'
     If non-`nil', use favicon cache file.

`w3m-favicon-default-background'
     Color name used as transparent color of favicon image.  `Nil' means
     to use the background color of the Emacs frame.  The null string
     "" is special, that will be replaced with the background color of
     the header line or the mode line on which the favicon is
     displayed.  Note that this value is effective only with Emacs 22
     and greater.

`w3m-icon-directory'
     Directory where emacs-w3m should find icon files.

`w3m-imagick-convert-program'
     Program name of ImageMagick's `convert'.

`w3m-treat-image-size'
     Non-`nil' means let the `w3m' command mind the ratio of the size
     of images and text.  The default value is `t'.

     If it is non-`nil', the `w3m' command will make a `halfdump' which
     reserves rectangle spaces in which images will be put, and also
     `alt' texts will be truncated or padded with spaces so that their
     display width will be the same as the width of images.

     See also `w3m-pixels-per-character' and `w3m-pixels-per-line'.
     Those values will be passed to the `w3m' command in order to
     compute columns and lines which images occupy.

`w3m-pixels-per-character'
     Integer used for the `-ppc' argument of the `w3m' command.  If
     `nil', the width of the default face is used.  It is valid only
     when `w3m-treat-image-size' is non-`nil'.  The default value is
     `nil'.  If you want to use emacs-w3m in a character terminal and
     make `w3m-treat-image-size' effective, you need to set this
     variable properly.

`w3m-pixels-per-line'
     Integer used for the `-ppl' argument of the `w3m' command.  If
     `nil', the height of the default face is used.  It is valid only
     when `w3m-treat-image-size' is non-`nil'.  Note that a small value
     may not induce a good result.  The default value is `64'.  If you
     want to use emacs-w3m in a character terminal and make
     `w3m-treat-image-size' effective, you need to set this variable
     properly.

`w3m-resize-image-scale'
     Number of steps in percent used when resizing images.

`w3m-resize-images'
     If non-`nil', resize images to the specified width and height.

`w3m-show-graphic-icons-in-header-line'
     Non-`nil' means show graphic status indicators in the header-line.
     If it is `nil', also the favicon won't be shown in the header-line
     even if `w3m-use-favicon' is non-`nil'.  This variable is
     currently meaningless under XEmacs.

`w3m-show-graphic-icons-in-mode-line'
     Non-`nil' means show graphic status indicators in the mode-line.
     If it is `nil', also the favicon won't be shown in the mode-line
     even if `w3m-use-favicon' is non-`nil'.

`w3m-toggle-inline-images-permanently'
     Non-`nil' means let the visibility of images continue permanently.
     The visibility of images is initialized according to
     `w3m-default-display-inline-images' at the first time, and except
     that it may be toggled by the `w3m-toggle-inline-images' command,
     it does not change hereafter, if it is non-`nil'.  Otherwise,
     whether images are visible is initialized according to
     `w3m-default-display-inline-images' whenever you visit a new page
     or reload the current page in an emacs-w3m buffer.

`w3m-use-favicon'
     Non-`nil' means show favicon images if they are available.  It will
     be set to `nil' automatically if ImageMagick's `convert' program
     does not support the ico format.

`w3m-image-default-background'
     Color name used as transparent color of image.  `Nil' means to use
     the background color of the Emacs frame.  The null string "" is
     special, that will be replaced with the background color of the
     buffer. Note that this value is effective only with Emacs 22 and
     greater.

5.15 Other variables
====================

`w3m-async-exec'
     Non-`nil' means execute the `w3m' command asynchronously in Emacs
     process.

`w3m-broken-proxy-cache'
     Set it to `t' if the proxy server seems not to work properly in
     caching.  Note that this may be the double-edged sword; setting it
     to `t' will likely be harmful if the proxy server sends bad
     requests (e.g., not including the Host header, see RFC2616 section
     14.23) to foreign servers when the `w3m' command specifies the
     `no-cache' directive.  Also note that it may not be effective if
     you are using old `w3m' command.

`w3m-history-minimize-in-new-session'
     Non-`nil' means minimize copied history so that there's only
     current page.  This variable is effective when creating of the new
     session by copying (i.e., `w3m-copy-buffer').  The default value is
     `nil'.

`w3m-history-reuse-history-elements'
     Non-`nil' means reuse the history element when re-visiting the
     page.  Otherwise, a new history element will be created even if
     there are elements for the same url in the history.

     Emacs-w3m used to operate as the case in which it is non-`nil',
     however it sometimes brought about users' dissatisfaction.  For
     example, if a user visited the pages A -> B -> C -> B in order,
     performing BACK on the second B would let a user visit A.  The
     reason why a user was taken to A rather than C is that the
     `w3m-history' variable only had the list `(A B C)' as a history
     and B was the current position at that time.

     The default value for this variable is `nil' which allows the
     `w3m-history' variable to have the list `(A B C B)'.  Where
     contents of two B's are the identical Lisp objects.  So, too much
     wasting the Lisp resources will be avoided.

     See the documentation for the variables `w3m-history' and
     `w3m-history-flat' for more information.

`w3m-process-connection-type'
     Value for `process-connection-type' used when communicating with
     `w3m'.

`w3m-process-modeline-format'
     Format used when displaying the progress of the external `w3m'
     process.  It shows a percentage of the data loaded from the web
     server.

`w3m-show-current-title-in-buffer-tab'
     If non-`nil', show the title strings in the buffers tab.  It has no
     effect if your XEmacs does not support the gutter items.

6 Hooking emacs-w3m into mail/newsreaders
*****************************************

This section introduces three Message User Agents (MUAs).  All those
MUAs can display HTML mails properly using emacs-w3m.  You'll find here
HowTo's and some notes about setting up and using emacs-w3m with each
of these MUAs.

   Quick note about the conventions we use: what does `message' mean?
When a Gnus user says `message', it often means a draft of a message to
be sent as mail or news.  However, it is the term used by Mew or
Wanderlust users for received mail.  They use `draft' for the draft of
a message to be sent.  On the other hand, a received message is called
an `article' by Gnus users.

* Menu:

* Gnus::                        Reading HTML mails in Gnus
* Mew::                         Reading HTML mails in Mew
* SEMI MUAs::                   Reading HTML mails in SEMI MUAs
* VM::                          VM (vieW maiL) is not Wanderlust

6.1 Reading HTML mails in Gnus
==============================

Did you know that Gnus, the Emacs newsreader, supports emacs-w3m?
Actually, Gnus bundled with Emacs of which the version is 22.1 or
greater supports emacs-w3m.  If your Emacs is somewhat old, you'd better
use the latest version of Gnus.  It is available at:

   `ftp://ftp.gnus.org/pub/gnus/gnus.tar.gz'

   * What can you do with emacs-w3m?

     You can convert HTML spam mails to be human-readable using
     emacs-w3m.  Of course, it works for HTML ham (non-spam) mails as
     well, and for both emacs-w3m is probably faster than the default
     converter.  You don't need to perform any additional operation.
     It will simply be displayed.

     On HTML parts of an article buffer, the `w3m-minor-mode' is turned
     on and you can use the same main keys as the keys of emacs-w3m, for
     instance, `<RET>' is for visiting a page which a link in the
     current position points to.  Those keys are defined in the
     `w3m-minor-mode-command-alist' variable.  Keep in mind that some
     commands are replaced by others similar to them, for security
     reasons (see below).

   * What do you have to do?

     Read the Gnus manual (*note Display Customization:
     (emacs-mime)Display Customization.).  The easiest way is to put
     the following line in your `~/.gnus.el' file:

          (setq mm-text-html-renderer 'w3m)

     Also put the following line if you want to show images inline in
     article buffers:

          (setq mm-inline-text-html-with-images t)

     If you don't need to use emacs-w3m keys in article buffers, add the
     following line too:

          (setq mm-inline-text-html-with-w3m-keymap nil)

   * Notes

     The above description about spam and ham is not for kidding, it's
     just here to get your attention.  Some HTML mails might contain a
     nasty trick used by spammers, using the `<img>' tag which is far
     more evil than the `Click Here!' button.  It is most likely
     intended to check whether the ominous spam mail has reached your
     eyes or not, in which case the spammer knows for sure that your
     email address is valid.  It is done by embedding an identifier
     string into a URL that you might automatically retrieve when
     displaying the image.  If the `mm-w3m-safe-url-regexp' variable
     has not been changed from the default value, Gnus will never
     connect to the spammer's site arbitrarily.

     You can display images inline in an article buffer if you set
     `mm-inline-text-html-with-images' to `t', can't you?  No, not
     exactly: you're still being protected.  If you don't care about
     leaking information (i.e. the fact that your mail address is
     reachable), set the `mm-w3m-safe-url-regexp' variable to `nil'.
     The default value for `mm-w3m-safe-url-regexp' is `"\\`cid:"'
     which means we consider that images included in a mail with the
     `cid:' URL are safe (that is, you can display such images without
     modifying the `mm-w3m-safe-url-regexp' variable).

   * Giveaway

     Even when you are in the summary buffer, you can toggle displaying
     of images in the article buffer.  It is effective only when those
     images are displayed by emacs-w3m, though.  Here's an example:

          (defun gnus-summary-w3m-safe-toggle-inline-images (&optional arg)
            "Toggle displaying of all images in the article buffer.
          If the prefix arg is given, force displaying of images."
            (interactive "P")
            (with-current-buffer gnus-article-buffer
              (let ((st (point-min))

6.2 Reading HTML mails in Mew
=============================

By using emacs-w3m with Mew, you can see HTML mails as it intended to be
displayed.  To do so, put the following line in the `~/.mew.el' file:

     (require 'mew-w3m)

With just this, an HTML mail will be displayed in the message window as
if it were a plain text.  You can still use the `C-c C-e' command
(`mew-summary-execute-external') there.

   It is also quite common these days to see mails containing the same
information twice, they use the `multipart/alternative' format which
consists of both a `text/plain' part and a `text/html' part (what a
waste of bandwidth it is).  Mew displays only the `text/plain' part of
such a mail by default.  However, you perhaps want to see the
`text/html' part since you are using emacs-w3m.  If so, add the
following lines to the `~/.mew.el' file:

     (setq mew-mime-multipart-alternative-list
           '("Text/Html" "Text/Plain" ".*"))

There are some customizable variables related to Mew:

`mew-use-w3m-minor-mode'
     If non-`nil', the `w3m-minor-mode' is turned on in the message
     buffer where a text/html part is displayed, and you can use the
     same main keys as the keys of emacs-w3m, for instance, `<RET>' is
     for visiting a page which a link in the current position points
     to.  Those keys are defined in the `w3m-minor-mode-command-alist'
     variable.  Keep in mind that some commands are replaced by others
     similar to them, for security reasons.  The default value is `nil'.

`mew-w3m-auto-insert-image'
     If non-`nil', you can see images inline in the message buffer when
     you read a multipart/related message.  Note that mew-w3m only
     allows images contained in the message body with a `cid:' URL to be
     displayed (as we consider them safe).  The default value is `nil'.

     To activate this feature, add following in your `~/.mew.el'.

          (define-key mew-summary-mode-map "T" 'mew-w3m-view-inline-image)

     Press "T", toggle the visibility of the images included its message
     only.  Press "C-uT", display the all images included its Text/Html
     part.

`mew-w3m-cid-retrieve-hook'
     A hook run just after retrieving a `cid:' URL.  The default value
     is `nil'.

6.3 Reading HTML mails in SEMI MUAs
===================================

You can display HTML mails as human-readable, using emacs-w3m and SEMI
MUA, for example, Wanderlust.  Since that MUA depends on SEMI (and also
FLIM) for MIME functions, we generically call it SEMI MUA.  Although
SEMI uses Emacs/W3 for rendering HTML mails by default, it can easily
be altered to emacs-w3m and it will make your cyber life still more
comfortable.

You simply need to put the following line in `~/.emacs' file:

     (require 'mime-w3m)

   The `mime-w3m' and `mime-w3' modules are functionally alike, as you
might have guessed (see how the names sound alike?).  The latter is
included in the SEMI package.

   On HTML parts of an article buffer, the `w3m-minor-mode' is turned
on and you can use the same main keys as the keys of emacs-w3m, for
instance, `<RET>' is for visiting a page which a link in the current
position points to.  Those keys are defined in the
`w3m-minor-mode-command-alist' variable.  Keep in mind that some
commands are replaced by others similar to them, for security reasons.

   There are some customizable variables related to the `mime-w3m'
module:

`mime-w3m-display-inline-images'
     If it is non-`nil', images will be displayed inline in HTML mails.
     If it is the symbol `default' (which is the default) at the first
     time, the value of this variable will be replaced with the value
     of the `w3m-default-display-inline-images' variable.  You probably
     don't need to change this.

`mime-w3m-safe-url-regexp'
     Regexp matching URLs which are considered to be safe.  The default
     value is `"\\`cid:"' which means we consider that images included
     in a mail with the `cid:' URLs are safe.  See also *note Gnus::
     about rogue attacks.

`mime-w3m-setup-hook'
     A hook run just after setting up the cooperation of the `mime-w3m'
     module and SEMI.  The default value is `nil'.

   By the way, even when you are in the summary buffer, you can toggle
displaying of images in the article buffer (which is what is called the
message buffer in the Wanderlust community).  It is effective only when
those images are displayed by emacs-w3m, though.  Here's an example for
Wanderlust:

     (defun wl-summary-w3m-safe-toggle-inline-images (&optional arg)
       "Toggle displaying of all images in the message buffer.
     If the prefix arg is given, all images are considered to be safe."
       (interactive "P")
       (with-current-buffer wl-message-buffer
         (w3m-toggle-inline-images arg)))

     (eval-after-load "wl-summary"
       '(define-key wl-summary-mode-map
          "\M-i" 'wl-summary-w3m-safe-toggle-inline-images))

6.4 VM (vieW maiL) is not Wanderlust
====================================

The module vm-w3m.el that provides the feature for VM to display html
mails and a patch have been handed over to the new VM maintainer,
although it has not appeared in the stable version of VM yet.  Try
visiting the VM home page (http://www.nongnu.org/viewmail/).

File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: General FAQ,  Next: Trouble FAQ,  Up: Frequently Asked Questions

7.1 General Questions
=====================

   * Q. What's emacs-w3m?

     It is an interface program on Emacs which controls w3m.  For more
     information, see *note Introduction::.

   * Q. Which emacs versions are supported?

     The following Emacsen have been checked for emacs-w3m support:

        * Emacs 21

        * Emacs 22

        * XEmacs 21.4.17 and later with/without Mule

        * XEmacs 21.5-b19 and later with/without Mule

        * Meadow

     Note that you're required to use APEL if you'd like to run
     emacs-w3m under XEmacs.  For more information, see *note Other
     Requirements::.

   * Q. Which w3m versions are supported?

     The following w3m versions have been checked for emacs-w3m support:

        * w3m-0.3 and later

        * w3mmee-p24-18 + moe-1.5.4

          Note that w3mmee mentioned as the example is configured with
          the `lang=many' option (it can be done by entering 3, when the
          `configure' script prompts you, "Which language do you
          prefer?").  It also requires the `libmoe' package.

   * Q. I've already installed APEL in the XEmacs SUMO package, is it
     ok?

     There are some problems in the XEmacs APEL package (all modules
     have been compiled for XEmacs with Mule); for instance, the
     `std11' modules conflict with the FLIM's one, etc.  Even though
     you can use `apel-1.23-pkg.tar.gz' or later for both XEmacs with
     Mule and non-Mule XEmacs if you don't use FLIM for the `shimbun'
     features, we recommend you replace it or newly install the
     original APEL package.  See *note Other Requirements:: where to
     get it from.

   * Q. I've gotten the developing version of emacs-w3m with CVS,
     however I'm missing `configure' script.

     It is necessary to run `autoconf' first, to generate `configure'
     script.

7.2 Troubleshooting
===================

   * Q. Why can't I enter a password on pages which require
     authentication?

     Make sure the `w3m-async-exec' variable is set to a value other
     than `nil'.

   * Q. Why can't I enter a password for a proxy server which requires
     authentication?

     Make sure the `w3m-async-exec' variable is set to a value other
     than `nil'.

   * Q. Why can't I follow links?

     Emacs-w3m requires a version of w3m which recognizes the `-header'
     option.  Check what version of w3m you use.

   * Q. Why do garbage characters appear?

     It could be caused by the following reasons:

       1. Bad HTML file

          If the character set specified by the `<meta>' tag differs
          from the actual contents in an HTML file, it will not be
          displayed correctly.  Use the command
          `M-x w3m-redisplay-with-charset <RET>' or `C c' to set the
          correct character set and to force redisplay of the page.

       2. Limitation of the character sets

          A page written by a character set other than
          ISO-2022-JP(jis), EUC-JP, or SHIFT_JIS may not be displayed
          correctly.  Try one of the following ways:

            a. Any characters defined in Unicode will be displayed
               correctly if you install the Mule-UCS package (*note
               Other Requirements::).  You need to make sure that the
               value of the `w3m-use-mule-ucs' variable is set to a
               value other than `nil' after installing the Mule-UCS
               package.  In addition, if you want to make Emacs (and
               also emacs-w3m) handle the character sets EUC-JISX0213
               and ISO-2022-JP-3, you have to install the `jisx0213'
               module which is contained in the Mule-UCS package
               (though it doesn't work under XEmacs unfortunately).

            b. Install w3mmee or w3m-m17n, and set the `w3m-command'
               variable to the appropriate value.  And emacs-w3m will
               use the multi-lingual features provided by one of those
               programs.  However, a page written by a coding system
               which Emacs doesn't support may not be displayed
               correctly. So please install Mule-UCS package if
               necessary.

       3. Emacsen incompatibility

          Under XEmacs 21.1, pages written by the SHIFT_JIS character
          set may not be displayed correctly.  There is also a problem
          in XEmacs 21.2 prior to the beta 36 version.  You should
          upgrade your XEmacs if you use such one.

          You should notice that XEmacs versions 21.1 and 21.2 have
          already been retired officially.

       4. Don't use `standard-display-european'

          It is generally harmful since it often makes Latin characters
          get displayed incorrectly.  For instance, the apostrophe
          character (`'') which was encoded as `&#8217' will be
          displayed as the character `u' with a grave accent as if it
          had been encoded as `&#249'.  If the line something like the
          following is in your `~/.emacs' file or site files which
          Emacs loads when starting up, we strongly recommend you to
          remove it.

               (standard-display-european 1)

          There the argument might be `t', not `1'.

   * Q. Why can't images be shown?

     It could be caused by the following reasons:

     There is a bug in the earlier versions of the `libungif' library.
     You have to install `libungif-4.1.0b1' and later.

     You must install the `gifsicle' program if you want to run
     emacs-w3m under XEmacs.  *Note Other Requirements::.

     Emacs-w3m doesn't support the old versions of w3m.  Check what
     version of w3m you use.

   * Q. Why can't I browse pages which require cookies?

     (This is still an experimental feature.)

     Make sure the `w3m-use-cookies' variable is set to a value other
     than `nil'.

   * Q. Why can't I fill in the form?

     (This is still an experimental feature.)

     Make sure the `w3m-use-form' variable is set to a value other than
     `nil'.

   * Q. Why can't I submit a form?

     (This is still an experimental feature.)

     Make sure the `w3m-use-form' variable is set to a value other than
     `nil'.  You also need to use a version of w3m which recognizes the
     `-post' option in order to use this function.  Check what version
     of w3m you use.

   * Q. Why are frames not rendered?

     Install w3mmee and put the following line in your `~/.emacs' file:

          (setq w3m-command "w3mmee")

   * Q. Why are favicon images not displayed in the tabs line on GNU
     Emacs?

     Install the `convert' program which is included in ImageMagick.
     It is available from: `http://www.imagemagick.org/'

   * Q. Why does GNU Emacs get locked when a favicon image is going to
     be displayed?

   * Q. My computer accesses the disk drive violently and says `process
     convert exited abnormally with code 10'.  What's the story?

     Do you use an old version of ImageMagick?  As far as we know, it
     happens when you use the `convert' program bundled with
     ImageMagick 5.2.1.  It has been confirmed that the `convert'
     program bundled with ImageMagick 5.4.0-5 (and later) works fine.

     If you don't want to use ImageMagick, or if you can't use its most
     recent version, add the following line in your `~/.emacs-w3m' file:

          (setq w3m-use-favicon nil)

   * Q. Why does not emacs-w3m work with w3mmee?

     If you are using w3mmee configured with the option `lang=en' or
     `lang=ja', reconfigure w3mmee with the option `lang=many' (it can
     be done by entering 3, when the `configure' script prompts you,
     "Which language do you prefer?"), and rebuild w3mmee.

   * Q. Why I cannot visit web pages using emacs-w3m?  There is no
     problem when visiting local html files or using w3m barefoot,
     though.

     What is called the asynch patch(1) is applied to the w3m command
     which some Linux distribution (e.g. Gentoo Linux) contains.  It is
     useful when using w3m barefoot, however it might make emacs-w3m
     hang.  If it is suspected, we recommend you reinstall the w3m
     command from the original source.

   * Q. Why doesn't the emacs-w3m frame pop up to the front?

     It is quite convenient that the `M-x w3m <RET>' command makes the
     emacs-w3m frame pop to the front even if it is hidden under the
     other frames.  However, it was reported that it does not work when
     running Emacs which has been built on some platforms (e.g., Fedora
     Linux) in which the `metacity' window manager is used.  In those
     systems, other features which raise the Emacs frames will not work,
     either.  If you are in such a miserable circumstance, it might be
     worth trying the following advice:

          (if (or (not window-system) (featurep 'xemacs))
              nil
            (defadvice raise-frame
              (after make-it-work (&optional frame) activate)
              "Make it work with the aid of wmctrl."
              (call-process
               "wmctrl" nil nil nil "-i" "-R"
               (frame-parameter (or frame (selected-frame))
                                'outer-window-id))))

     Where `wmctrl' is the external command which you can get from:

     `http://sweb.cz/tripie/utils/wmctrl/'

     Note that you have to install the `wmctrl' command before putting
     the advice into the `~/.emacs' file.

     The following one is currently unnecessary for emacs-w3m, but a
     certain application needs it to work.  (You will lose nothing by
     adding it if you are in the platform in which the previous one is
     needed.)

          (if (or (not window-system) (featurep 'xemacs))
              nil
            (defadvice pop-to-buffer (after enable-it-to-forcus-frame
                                            activate)
              "Enable it to focus frame if `pop-up-frames' is non-nil."
              (when pop-up-frames
                (let ((id (condition-case nil
                              (frame-parameter
                               (window-frame
                                (get-buffer-window (ad-get-arg 0)))
                               'outer-window-id)
                            (error nil))))
                  (when id
                    (call-process
                     "wmctrl" nil nil nil "-i" "-R" id))))))

     The last one is perhaps unnecessary but it might be worth trying
     in some platforms.

          (if (or (not window-system)(featurep 'xemacs))
              nil
            (defadvice select-frame (around set-input-focus
                                            (frame) activate)
              "Run `select-frame-set-input-focus'."
              (setq ad-return-value (and (framep frame)
                                         (frame-live-p frame)
                                         frame))
              (ad-deactivate 'select-frame)
              (unwind-protect
                  (select-frame-set-input-focus frame)
                (ad-activate 'select-frame))))

     These workarounds will become unnecessary in subsequent Emacs
     releases (22.2 or 23.1).

7.3 Questions of Shimbun Library
================================

   * Q. Why are the `shimbun' modules not installed?

     Note that the `shimbun' modules (files under the `shimbun/'
     directory) won't be installed if the FLIM package has not been
     installed in your system.

     The `configure' script determines automatically whether the FLIM
     package is installed or not.  If the FLIM package is installed in
     a non-standard directory, the determination fails.  In this case,
     you can use the `--with-addpath' configure option to explicitly
     set the directory name where the FLIM package has been installed.
     Here's an example:

          % ./configure --with-addpath=$HOME/share/emacs/site-lisp/flim

9 A tool for reading a newspaper
********************************

More and more newspapers, mailing list archives, bulletin boards, and
individual diaries (such as hyper nikki system, weblogs and blogs) are
published on the web.  `Shimbun' library enables you to read those
contents with your favorite mail/news reader.  Actually, `Shimbun'
library provides functions to convert those contents into articles like
common e-mails.

     `Shimbun' is pronounced "she-n-boon" (but actually vowels
     shouldn't be prolonged), it means "newspaper" in Japanese.

   The `shimbun' module has the goal to generate articles that are as
readable as normal mail or news posting.  This goal is often difficult
to achieve as web sites change the html of their articles.

   If you notice (even small) annoyances like nonsense images within the
text or any other text that is not related to the article please report
them using `report-emacs-w3m-bug' (*note Mailing List::).

   `Shimbun' library currently supports Asahi Shimbun, Yomiuri On-line,
many mailing list archives such as Emacs Devel, XEmacs Beta, Gnus, Mew,
and Wanderlust, Slashdot, Slashdot Japan, and a lot of others.  For
more detail, see *note Shimbun Sites::.

   By the way, you have to pay attention to copyright when using
`Shimbun' library.  Copyrights of articles generated with `Shimbun'
library are reserved by copyright holders of those original contents.
Therefore, you are obliged not to violate rights of copyright holders,
when you enjoy generated articles.  It means that you can enjoy
generated articles on "fair use" that is described in the copyright law.

   We, emacs-w3m development team, give no warranty to you, if
`Shimbun' library causes a damage to you, or if you face a lawsuit
about violation of copyrights.

   `Shimbun' library is a collection of many modules, but each of them
serves no useful purpose alone.  This section explains three typical
`Shimbun' applications (two of which are included in the `Shimbun'
library) and how to make `Shimbun' modules by yourself (you need to be
able to write Emacs Lisp programs).

   Note that you need to have installed the FLIM package (and Gnus if
you'd like to use `nnshimbun') before building and installing
emacs-w3m.  The FLIM package requires the APEL package.  You might also

9.1 Turning Gnus into a web browser!
====================================

`Nnshimbun' is a Gnus back end, but it is distributed with emacs-w3m,
not Gnus, exceptionally.  `Nnshimbun' allows you to turn Gnus into an
exceptionally useful web browser.  You can skim through the articles on
a newspaper's web server without having to see all the advertisement.
You can read articles in mailing list archives as if you were
subscribed to the list.  You can also read submissions in bulletin
boards, etc...  Note that if you want to followup, you still need to use
emacs-w3m as Gnus can't post via the web with `nnshimbun'.

   See also *note Gnus:: for rendering HTML messages with emacs-w3m if
you use Gnus.

   The easiest way to get started with `nnshimbun' is to use something
like the following in the Group buffer:

   `M-x gnus-group-make-shimbun-group <RET> asahi <RET> national <RET>'

Replace `asahi' and `national' with the keyword corresponding to the
server you'd like to connect to and the group you're interested in
respectively.  You can complete both of those names by using `<TAB>' or
`<SPC>'.

   You can also bind that to a key if there's enough room in the
`gnus-group-mode-map' map, you can add something like the following in
your `~/.gnus.el' file:

     (eval-after-load "gnus-group"
       '(define-key gnus-group-mode-map "Gn"
          'gnus-group-make-shimbun-group))

Then, you can use `G n' instead of `M-x gnus-group-make-shimbun-group'.

   _Could someone book this keystroke at the Gnus Tower?_

Besides this, you can use the `gnus-group-make-shimbun-groups' command
in order to make all groups for the specified server.

   `Nnshimbun' simply fetches HTML contents from the web server and
displays them as an article, but it will never save articles in the
local file system, except if you use persistent articles (*note
Persistent Articles: (gnus)Persistent Articles.).  `Nnshimbun' uses NOV
files for each `nnshimbun' group, and its back end is almost the same as
`nnml'.

   The following `nnshimbun' variables can be customized:

`nnshimbun-keep-backlog'
     This variable overrides the `gnus-keep-backlog' variable (*note
     Article Backlog: (gnus)Article Backlog.) in `nnshimbun' groups.
     If you set `nnshimbun-keep-backlog' to a number N, `nnshimbun'
     will store at most N old articles in a buffer for later
     re-fetching.  If this variable is non-`nil' and is not a number,
     `nnshimbun' will store _all_ read articles (this is not a good
     idea).  The default value is 300.

     Note that smaller values may spoil the `prefetch-articles' feature
     (see below), since `nnshimbun' uses the backlog to keep the
     prefetched articles.

`nnshimbun-directory'
     Directory where `nnshimbun' saves NOV and marks files.  The
     default value is `~/News/shimbun/'.  This is a server variable
     (*note Server Variables: (gnus)Server Variables.).

`nnshimbun-default-group-level'
     The default group level overriding `gnus-level-default-subscribed'.
     It will be applied to newly created `nnshimbun' groups.  The
     default value is `nil'.  This is a server variable (*note Server
     Variables: (gnus)Server Variables.).

`nnshimbun-marks-is-evil'
     If non-`nil', Gnus will never generate and use marks file for
     `shimbun' spools.  Using marks files makes it possible to backup
     and restore `shimbun' groups separately from `.newsrc.eld'.  If
     you have, for some reason, set this to `t', and want to set it to
     `nil' again, you should always remove the corresponding marks file
     (usually named `.marks' in the `shimbun' group directory, but see
     `nnshimbun-marks-file-name') for the group.  Then the marks file
     will be regenerated properly by Gnus.  The default value is `nil'.
     This is a server variable (*note Server Variables: (gnus)Server
     Variables.).

   You can use the specially made group parameter for `nnshimbun' in
addition to the standard group parameters provided by Gnus(1).  Several
parameters for `nnshimbun' are collected into the single group
parameter `nnshimbun-group-parameters' which is a property list (the
values can be different for every group).  Here's an example:

     '(index-range all prefetch-articles off encapsulate-images on
                   expiry-wait 6)

   Below is the documentation for those group parameters and related
variables.

`prefetch-articles'
     In a group where this group parameter is set to something else than
     `off' or `nil', `nnshimbun' not only checks for new articles, but
     also downloads them.  Though it will slow checking of new articles
     down, you won't be kept waiting when reading articles.  In the
     group where this group parameter is not set or its value is `nil',
     the value of the `nnshimbun-pre-fetch-article' variable (`off' by
     default) is used instead.

`encapsulate-images'
     In a group where this group parameter is set to something else than
     `off' or `nil', `nnshimbun' will put image data embedded in the
     original contents into an article as `multipart/related' parts of
     the MIME format.  In the group where this group parameter is not
     set or its value is `nil', the value of the
     `nnshimbun-encapsulate-images' variable is used instead.  The
     default value for the `nnshimbun-encapsulate-images' variable is
     the value of the `shimbun-encapsulate-images' variable which is
     provided in the `shimbun' library (the default value is probably
     `t').

`index-range'
     You can specify the range of articles to be fetched from the web
     server using the `index-range' group parameter.  To specify the
     range, use the following values:

    `nil'
    `all'
          all pages

    `last'
          only the latest page

    `integer N'
          the latest N pages

     `Nnshimbun' checks whether there are new articles by parsing the
     index page of the server.  It is possible that there are two or
     more index pages on the server.  For instance, in the case of the
     mailing list servers, index pages are generally classified
     according to the date on which the article was posted.  It would
     take a considerable amount of time to check all those huge index
     pages especially if you are connecting via a slow line.

     If it is possible, `nnshimbun' won't check index pages which have
     already been checked at the last connection.  If you want to save
     even more time, use `last'.  It makes `nnshimbun' refer to only the
     latest index page for checking new articles.

     In the group where the `index-range' group parameter is not set or
     its value is `nil', the value of the `nnshimbun-index-range'
     variable (`2' by default) is used.

`nnshimbun-group-parameters-alist'
     This is an Emacs Lisp variable, an alist of regexp of group names
     and `nnshimbun' group parameters.  The default value is `nil'.
     Each element may have the form `(REGEXP KEYWORD VALUE KEYWORD
     VALUE...)', for example:

          '("^nnshimbun\\+asahi:" index-range all prefetch-articles off
            encapsulate-images on expiry-wait 6)

     Since you can use this variable to specify the same `nnshimbun'
     group parameters for two or more groups which have similar names
     (i.e., those groups are likely to have similar characteristics
     each other), it is useful that it can be used instead of
     specifying the `nnshimbun' group parameters to several groups
     respectively.  If the group parameter has already been set in a
     group, that takes precedence over this variable.

   You can instruct `nnshimbun' to expire articles(2).  Keep in mind
that when an article is expired, it is not deleted from the remote
server, it's still available there.  What is deleted is the line in
your own NOV file for `nnshimbun'(3) corresponding to the article to be
expired.  Then the article won't appear in the Summary buffer, forever
and ever.

   If you don't expire articles in `nnshimbun' groups, the NOV files
will continue to grow fat indefinitely and you may see very old
articles in the Summary buffer as if they were existing (in fact, they
might have expired three years ago on the remote server!).  Even if you
try to read such an article, nothing will appear in the article buffer.
On the other hand, most mailing list servers generally offer all the
past articles.  You may not feel like expiring articles in such groups
in order to look back with nostalgia to the good old days and to be
able to read, eyes filled with tears, articles which you thought long
gone.

   You can mark `nnshimbun' articles as expirable and specify the
expiry period in each `nnshimbun' group as well as the other mail back
ends.  However, there are a little differences between `nnshimbun' and
the other mail back ends:

   * First of all, the expiry period is determined with the following
     priorities.  Note that the default value might be different from
     group to group.

       1. The value of the `expiry-wait' group parameter in a group.

       2. The value produced by evaluating the
          `nnmail-expiry-wait-function' variable for a group.

       3. The default value provided by the `shimbun' module
          corresponding to a group.

       4. The value of the `nnmail-expiry-wait' variable.

   * Second of all, the argument to be passed to the function specified
     by the `nnmail-expiry-wait-function' variable will contain the
     names of the back end and the server like
     "nnshimbun+asahi:national", while only the group name will be
     given in the case of the other mail back ends.  Here's an example:

          (setq nnmail-expiry-wait-function
                (lambda (group)
                  (cond ((string-equal group "ding") 7)
                        ((string-equal group "nnshimbun+ding:ding") 'never))))

     This means that there are two groups for the same ding mailing
     list; one is subscribed as a list member, the other is for reading
     from the mailing list archive at the Gnus Towers.  Ahem, isn't it
     clever?  The local mail files in the "ding" group will be expired
     in seven days and your local disk space will be saved, but you can
     read even the articles of the last century in the second group (if
     it is really needed, though).

   * Third of all, and this is written down so that you can remember it
     when you're filled with doubt: even when all articles from a
     `nnshimbun' group should be expired, the most recent one will be
     kept.  This is not to satisfy your indecisive heart, it's because
     the next time you fetch new articles for this group, `nnshimbun'
     will know where to begin and not fetch all the articles all over
     again.

   The group parameters and the variables related to expiring
`nnshimbun' articles are:

`expiry-wait'
     Don't be confused, please.  The `expiry-wait' group parameter is
     provided as one of the elements of `nnshimbun-group-parameters',
     the specially made group parameter for `nnshimbun'.  It has the
     same name and the same meaning as the standard group parameter.
     You may use whichever you like.  If nnshimbun's one is set to
     non-`nil' value, it takes precedence over the standard one.  It is
     provided in order to concentrate things related to `nnshimbun' at
     one place of the "Gnus Customize" buffer (which will appear by
     typing `G c' in the group buffer) and to realize managing
     collectively by the `nnshimbun-group-parameters-alist' variable(4).
     The values which can be used are a number of expiry period, `never'
     or `immediate' as well as the standard group parameter.

`nnshimbun-keep-unparsable-dated-articles'
     If this variable is non-`nil', the articles of which the time of
     creation (or the time of arrival) is unknown will never be expired,
     since their age is unknown.  The default is `t'.  If you set this
     variable to `nil', the articles of which the time is unknown will
     also be expired unconditionally when the time to expire has come.
     Well, it might prove useful for a general cleaning at the end of a
     year.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The easiest way to specify group parameters is to type `G c' in
the group buffer after moving the point to the group you'd like to
customize (*note Group Parameters: (gnus)Group Parameters.).

   (2) There are mainly two ways to expire articles automatically in
the `nnshimbun' groups.  One is to add a group name regular expression
(it should begin with "^nnshimbun\\+") to the
`gnus-auto-expirable-newsgroups' variable and to put the expiry period
for each group into the `nnmail-expiry-wait-function' variable.
Another is to set the `auto-expire' group parameter to `t' and to set
the expiry period with the `expiry-wait' group parameter in every
`nnshimbun' group which you want to expire automatically.  See *Note
Expiring Mail: (gnus)Expiring Mail, for more information.  In the group
to which the `expiry-wait' group parameter is not specified, a default
expiry period will be applied.

   (3) The NOV file for `nnshimbun' is named something like
"~/News/shimbun/asahi/national/.overview".

   (4) We've already prepared the answer to the question that why
`auto-expire' etc. aren't included in the nnshimbun's special group
parameter?  The answer is, `expiry-wait' is handled by the `nnshimbun'
back end, but `auto-expire' is handled by the Gnus core.  Therefore, it
is contrary to the design policy of Gnus to extend the Gnus core
functions so that it may work for one particular back end (i.e. reading
a value from the nnshimbun's special group parameter).

9.2 Reading web newspapers with Mew
===================================

Mew Shimbun is an Emacs Lisp program meant to be used with `shimbun'
and Mew (version 2.1 and later).  The `mew-shimbun' module will be
installed together with emacs-w3m if Mew, APEL, and FLIM are also
installed.

   We recommend you also see *note Mew::.

  1. Setting things up

     Put the following lines in the last of the `~/.mew.el' file:

     ;;; Loading mew-shimbun, defining keys.
     ;; (setq mew-shimbun-use-unseen t)              ;;; (1)
     (require 'mew-shimbun)
     (define-key mew-summary-mode-map "G"  (make-sparse-keymap))
     (define-key mew-summary-mode-map "Gg" 'mew-shimbun-goto-folder)
     (define-key mew-summary-mode-map "GG" 'mew-shimbun-goto-unseen-folder)
     (define-key mew-summary-mode-map "Gi" 'mew-shimbun-retrieve)
     (define-key mew-summary-mode-map "GI" 'mew-shimbun-retrieve-all)
     (define-key mew-summary-mode-map "Gr" 'mew-shimbun-re-retrieve)
     (define-key mew-summary-mode-map "GR" 'mew-shimbun-re-retrieve-all)
     (define-key mew-summary-mode-map "Ge" 'mew-shimbun-expire)
     (define-key mew-summary-mode-map "GE" 'mew-shimbun-expire-all)

     ;; Specifying `shimbun' servers and groups to be read with Mew in the
     ;; `mew-shimbun-folder-groups' variable.  Each element has the form
     ;; `("folder" ("server.group" . range) ...)'.  You can use `all',
     ;; `last', and a number for the `range' item.

     (setq mew-shimbun-folder-groups
           '(;; Fetching `yomiuri.national', `yomiuri.sports', etc.
             ;; into the `+shimbun/yomiuri' folder collectively.
             ("yomiuri"
              ("yomiuri.national" . 2)
              ("yomiuri.sports". 2)
              ("yomiuri.world". 2))
             ;; Fetching `security-memo.memo'
             ;; into `+shimbun/security-memo'.
             ("security-memo"
              ("security-memo.memo" . 2))
             ("slashdot-jp"
              ("slashdot-jp.story" . last))
             ;; You can read several groups in one folder (`+shimbun/emacs')
             ;; as follows even if each group comes from a different server.
             ("emacs"
              ("airw.wl" . last)
              ("emacs-w3m.emacs-w3m" . last))
             ;; Fetching diaries into `+shimbun/hns/arisawa' and
             ;; `+shimbun/hns/miyoshi' respectively.
             ("hns/arisawa"
              ("hns.arisawa" . last))
             ("hns/miyoshi"
              ("hns.miyoshi" . last))))

     You did the fundamental setups.  For the other user definable
     variables, use `M-x customize-group' for the `mew-shimbun' group or
     see the source code.

  2. Reading `shimbun' messages

       a. Getting started

          Type `G I' (`mew-shimbun-retrieve-all') first, after setting
          things up as mentioned above.  The `shimbun' folders
          specified by the `mew-shimbun-folder-groups' variable will be
          created under the `+shimbun' parent folder.  Typing `G I' is
          also useful when you have added new groups.  You can change
          the name of the parent folder (`+shimbun' by default) by
          customizing the `mew-shimbun-folder' variable.

       b. Moving into a `shimbun' folder

          You can move to any folder (including `shimbun') by typing `g'
          (`mew-summary-goto-folder'), but `G g'
          (`mew-shimbun-goto-folder') is restricted to moving to only
          the `shimbun' folder.  In addition, folders which have new
          messages (in other words, folders which have not been
          scanned) will be displayed when using a prefix argument with
          `G g' (i.e.  `C-u G g').  A prefix argument similarly affects
          `G G' as well.

       c. Fetching messages in each folder

          You can fetch new messages for the current folder exclusively
          by typing `G i' (`mew-shimbun-retrieve') in a `shimbun'
          folder.

       d. Fetching updated messages

          If you perform the `G r' command (`mew-shimbun-re-retrieve')
          when a particular message is being displayed, the message
          will be updated if it is possible, and new messages will be
          fetched.  With a prefix argument (i.e.  `C-u G r'), it will
          attempt to update messages which are marked with the mark
          specified by the `mew-shimbun-mark-re-retrieve' variable (`@'
          by default).  It would be useful for CNET, etc.

          The `G R' command (`mew-shimbun-re-retrieve-all') checks the
          freshness of all messages and re-fetches the updated
          messages.  If a prefix argument is given (i.e. `C-u G R'),
          the messages within the region will be processed.  It is
          probably worthwhile if the site is running the hyper nikki
          system (`nikki' means "diary" in Japanese).

  3. Managing unseen messages

     If you have the following setting in the `~/.mew.el' file,

          (setq mew-shimbun-use-unseen t)

     newly fetched messages will be marked with the mark specified by
     the `mew-shimbun-mark-unseen' variable (`*' by default), and it
     will disappear automatically after reading the message.

     Normally, the unseen marks will not be saved in the `.mew-cache'
     file if scanning is not performed after adding or deleting marks
     in the Mew summary mode, but if you add the following line to the
     `~/.mew.el' file,

          (setq mew-shimbun-use-unseen-cache-save t)

     the unseen marks will be saved in the `.mew-cache' file
     automatically for the `shimbun' groups when exiting Mew or killing
     a folder (using `C-c C-q').  However, it is not securely saved
     (2).  To do this securely, you had better have the habit of
     performing the `scan update' command after reading the folder.

     If you don't like the `*' mark for unseen messages, customize the
     `mew-shimbun-mark-unseen' variable (see above).  By specifying the
     mark by `C-u N', you will be able to lead a better life with
     taking care of unseen messages.

  4. Expiring messages

     You can expire messages if you set the `mew-shimbun-expires'
     variable beforehand.  For example:

          (setq mew-shimbun-expires
                '(("yomiuri" . 7)
                  ("asahi" . 1)
                  ("slashdot-jp" . 7)
                  ("emacs" . 7)))

     If you set this variable as shown above, you can specify the expiry
     period; 7 days for `+shimbun/yomiuri', 1 day for `+shimbun/asahi'.
     Messages in the `shimbun' folder where the expiry period is not
     specified will never be expired.  You can use the `G e' command
     (`mew-shimbun-expire') to expire the expirable messages in the
     current folder.  The `G E' command (`mew-shimbun-expire-all') is
     for expiring the expirable messages in all the `shimbun' folders.
     Note that once the messages have been expired, you cannot recover
     them.

  5. How to mark messages with `$' as unseen

     Put the following lines in the `~/.mew.el' file in order to define
     the `$' mark and use `$' for the mark of unseen.  See
     `http://www.mew.org/ml/mew-dist-2.0/msg01251.html' if you would
     like to replace the `$' mark with another.

     ;;---------------------------------------------------------------------
     ;;; Code for using `$' as the unseen mark.
     (setq mew-mark-unseen ?$)
     (setq mew-shimbun-mark-unseen mew-mark-unseen)
     (setq mew-mark-show-list (cons mew-mark-unseen mew-mark-show-list))
     (setq mew-mark-afterstep-spec
           (cons (cons mew-mark-unseen '(1 0 1 0 0 0 0))
                 mew-mark-afterstep-spec))
     (setq mew-mark-spec
           (cons (list mew-mark-unseen "unseen" 0 nil nil nil nil nil)

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Uncomment this line if you'd like to manage unseen messages.  It
must be placed before the `(require 'mew-shimbun)' line.

   (2) People who have set the `mew-touch-folder-p' variable to `t'
will succeed 100% in saving marks, but people who use `nil' value seem
not to be 0% successful.

9.3 Reading web newspapers with Wanderlust
==========================================

Wanderlust includes `elmo-shimbun' as an ELMO module, so you can read
`shimbun' by just accessing a folder beginning with `@' (*note Shimbun
Folder: (wl)Shimbun Folder.).

9.4 Using a shell script to fetch shimbun feeds
===============================================

If you read lots of `shimbuns', checking those for new articles can
take some time due to emacs-w3m retrieving the feeds one by one.  If you
want to speed this up, you can use a shell script to retrieve the feeds,
which you can either call manually (e.g. from within Emacs) or
automatically through schedulers like cron.  The feeds must be saved in
specially named files, and emacs-w3m will then use those files instead
of calling w3m.

   The following variables control the local mode:

`shimbun-use-local'
     Setting this to `t' will activate the local mode, meaning that
     emacs-w3m will first check if a feed is available as a local file.
     If it cannot be found, it will be retrieved through w3m as usual.

`shimbun-local-path'
     This is the directory where the shimbun files are stored.  The
     default value is `w3m-default-save-directory'.

   The file name for a feed is expected to be the MD5 of the URL,
truncated to the first 10 characters, appended with the string
`_shimbun'.  You can easily generate the file name for a feed in Emacs
through

     (concat (substring (md5 "http://example/feed") 0 10) "_shimbun")

   If you use Gnus with `nnshimbun', there is already a function which
will generate a download shell script for all currently subscribed
shimbun groups.  Just call `nnshimbun-generate-download-script', and it
will generate the shell script in a new buffer which you can save
afterwards.  If you call the function with a prefix, it will put an
ampersand after each w3m call, so that the feeds are retrieved in
parallel.

     Those groups generate articles containing only text by default.
     If you would like to make them generate HTML articles that contain
     not only text but also photographs, add the following line to your
     `~/.emacs' file:

          (setq shimbun-asahi-prefer-text-plain nil)

     On the other hand, you can also use the `asahi-html' back end to
     generate HTML articles.  In order to use it, specify
     `asahi-html.business' instead of `asahi.business' as the group
     name for example.

     The New York Times began to offer news articles for free on
     September 19, 2007.  In spite of having said `charset=iso-8859-1',
     this site often uses the `windows-1252' charset that is a superset
     of `iso-8859-1'.  `Shimbun' (and also emacs-w3m) works in even
     such a case if the `windows-1252' coding system is available in

     formerly.  If it becomes required again in the future, visit the
     registration page
     (http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/guide/inf_regi.html) to have it.
     The following two variables control how you log in:

    `shimbun-tech-on-user-name'
          User name to log in on Tech-On! with.  If it is `nil', you
          will be prompted for a user name when logging in on Tech-On!
          with.  If it is a string, it will be used as a user name and
          you will never be prompted.  If it is neither `nil' nor a
          string (that is the default), you will never log in.

    `shimbun-tech-on-password'
          Password to use to log in on Tech-On! with.  If it is `nil',
          you will be prompted for a password when logging in on
          Tech-On! with.  If it is a string, it will be used as a
          password and you will never be prompted.  If it is neither
          `nil' nor a string (that is the default), you will never log
          in.

     Entering them is required only once in the Emacs session at the
     first time to start reading a Tech-On! article.

            '(setq shimbun-tcup-group-alist
                   (append
                    '(("foo" "http://MMMM.teacup.com/foo/bbs2")
                      ("bar" "http://NNNN.teacup.com/bar/bbs2"))
                    shimbun-tcup-group-alist)))

                '(("henahena"                          ;; Group Name
                   "http://www.fan.gr.jp/~ring/d/")    ;; URL
                  ("yoichi"
                   "http://yoichi.geiin.org/d/")))

Diaries at Rakuten Plaza (http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/)
     This is an example to use `sb-rakuten'.
          (setq shimbun-rakuten-group-alist
                '(("rakuten-id" . "email-address")))

RSS feeds containing contents
     To use this back end, look for the RSS feeds containing contents
     which you would like to read, and add those groups to the
     `shimbun-rss-hash-group-path-alist' variable by the following way.
     The name of the back end is `rss-hash'.  You may use this back end
     for reading mainly personal blogs.

     The parameters for each group configuration consist of the name of
     the group, the address of the RSS feed, the type of the mail (`t'
     for html), the regexp matching the start of contents, and the
     regexp matching the end of contents.  The parameters other than
     the name of the group and the address of the RSS feed are optional.

     Here is an example of setting `shimbun-rss-hash-group-path-alist'.
     In this case, you can browse those groups as `rss-hash.sampleblog1'
     and `rss-hash.sampleblog2':

          (setq shimbun-rss-hash-group-path-alist
                '(;; text mail
                  ("sampleblog1" "http://www.example.com/index1.rss")
                  ;; html mail
                  ("sampleblog2" "http://www.example.com/index2.rss"
                   t "</title>" "<!-- start ads")))

Atom feeds containing contents
     As well as the previous section (RSS feeds containing contents),
     you can also read the Atom feeds which contain published contents.
     To do that, configure the variable
     `shimbun-atom-hash-group-path-alist' (and possibly
     `shimbun-atom-hash-x-face-alist', etc.) in the way similar to
     shimbun-rss-hash-*.  The name of the back end is `atom-hash'.

RSS feeds without published content
     Many feeds do not contain the full content of the articles, or
     only so called teasers, i.e. quick summaries.  If a site publishes
     such a feed, instead of writing a special shimbun for it, you can
     in many cases use the `rss-blogs' back end.  The setup is similar
     to the `rss-hash' shimbun; here is an example:

          (setq shimbun-rss-blogs-group-url-regexp
            '(("first-feed" "http://example/wordpressfeed")
              ("second-feed" "http://example/somefeed"
               "<div name=\"content\">" "<div name=\"comments\">")
              ("third-feed" "http://example/someotherfeed" 'none)))

     The first two items are the name and the URL of the feed.
     Optionally, you can give two regular expressions denoting the
     start and end of the actual content on the HTML pages the feed is
     pointing to.  If you just use the symbol `none' here, no filtering
     will be done whatsoever.  Additionally, the `rss-blogs' shimbun
     can deal automatically with some popular blogging engines, namely
     Google's Blogger/Blogspot (including comment feeds), WordPress,
     and TypePad.  If your feed is from a site using one of those
     (which you can see by looking at the `generator' tag), just omit
     the optional parameters and the code will try to extract the
     content automatically for you.

Wiki contents
     This is an example to use `sb-wiki'.  `sb-wiki' support PukiWiki
     and Hiki.  If you don't know which regexps to set to 4th and 5th
     elements of an inner list, just set `nil' and you'll just see all
     contents of a page.
          (setq shimbun-wiki-group-alist
                '(("pukiwiki" ;; Group Name
                   "http://pukiwiki.org/index.php?cmd=rss10" ;; URL
                   "webmaster@pukiwiki.org" ;; E-Mail Address
                   nil ;; X-Face
                   "\n<h3 id=\"" ;; regexp to represent contents start
                   "</address>") ;; regexp to represent contents end
                  ("hiki"
                   "http://www.namaraii.com/hiki/?c=rss"
                   "webmaster@fdiary.net"
                   nil
                   "<div class=\"section\">"
                   "<div class=\"sidebar\">")
                  ("apollo"
                   "http://wiki.fdiary.net/apollo/?c=rss"
                   "moriq@moriq.com"
                   nil
                   "<div class=\"section\">"
                   "<div class=\"sidebar\">")
                  ))

Yahoo! AUCTIONS (http://auctions.yahoo.co.jp/)
     This is an example to use `sb-yahoo-auctions'.
          (setq shimbun-yahoo-auctions-group-alist
                '(("mp3player" . "http://list3.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/jp/show/catleaf_rss?category=2084039708&alocale=0jp")
                  ("iPod" . "http://search3.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/search_rss?p=iPod&auccat=2084039708&alocale=0jp&acc=jp")))

9.6 How to make a new shimbun module
====================================

`Shimbun' is a library set of emacs-w3m that enables you to read
certain web contents using Gnus, Wanderlust, or Mew as if they were
email messages.  Here we will explain how to make a new `shimbun'
module.

File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Overview,  Next: Getting web page and header information,  Up: Shimbun Basics

9.6.1 Overview
--------------

When you make a new `shimbun' module `foobar' for reading contents of
`http://www.foobar.net', what you have to do first is to put the
following S expressions in the first part of the `sb-foobar.el' file:

     (require 'shimbun)
     (luna-define-class shimbun-foobar (shimbun) ())

We will explain what they are below, so you can understand they are just
incantations now.  You have to use the same suffix `foobar' in the file
name (`sb-foobar.el') and the class name (`shimbun-foobar') as the
second argument for the `luna-define-class' macro.

   Major jobs of the `shimbun-foobar' module can be classified broadly
into the following four categories (note that you may rephrase "folder"
with "group" if you are a Gnus user):

  1. Getting a page source from `http://www.foobar.net' in order to
     gather articles' subjects etc. when a MUA opens the `foobar'
     folder.

  2. Gathering subjects and other necessary informations from the page
     source in order to make headlines of articles and returning them
     as the structured list called `headers'.

  3. Getting a page source for an article from the web site, for
     example, `http://www.foobar.net/053003.html', when MUA requires to
     display an article in the `foobar' folder, and

  4. Removing cruft, e.g. advertisements, from the page source and
     formatting a raw article.

`shimbun-headers' of `shimbun.el' does the first job,
`shimbun-get-headers' does the second, `shimbun-article' does the third
and `shimbun-make-contents' does the last.

   The `shimbun-headers' method does the first job, the
`shimbun-get-headers' method does the second, the `shimbun-article'
method does the third and the `shimbun-make-contents' method does the
last thing.  The default methods for those categories are defined in
the `shimbun.el' module.

   Open the `shimbun.el' file.  You may see unfamiliar definitions like
`luna-define-generic' or `luna-define-method' there.  Hm, they look
like `defun', don't you?  You may also see there's just a doc-string in
the former definition and the same symbol is declared again in the
later form.  And further, there are some symbols only declared by the
`luna-define-generic' form, not by the `luna-define-method' form.  What
on earth are we seeing?  Isn't the program not written in the
Emacs-Lisp language?

   The truth is that the `shimbun' modules use the `luna.el' module
provided by FLIM which enables you to write object oriented programs in
the Emacs-Lisp language.

   There are method programs defined rigidly for the specific purposes
in the `shimbun.el' module.  The `shimbun-headers' method gets a page
source from a certain URL, the `shimbun-get-headers' method gathers
subjects and other informations, etc... (see above).  They do routine
works, so they cannot take proper method to meet various web contents
in the world.  Eh?  Oh, you shouldn't believe in a heresy!

   The `shimbun.el' module only provides the default method functions.
Remember the `defadvice' feature.  There are three ways to modify the
behavior of a function: `:before', `:around' and `:after'.  Similarly,
each default `shimbun' method function can be modified for a certain
purpose (note that the `:around' method-qualifier can be omitted).  And
it should be written specially that the modification will be effective
only when the specified `shimbun' module is selected.

   Now as you may have understood that the `luna-define-generic' form
provides only a husk in a sense, the `luna-define-method' form defines
an actual function which can be different for each `shimbun' module,
and the `luna-define-class' form declares the `shimbun' class in the
first part of the `sb-foobar.el' module.


File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Getting web page and header information,  Next: Displaying an article,  Prev: Overview,  Up: Shimbun Basics

9.6.2 Getting web page and header information
---------------------------------------------

Let's identify a target web page URL to gather subjects and other
informations first.  If a web site uses a frame, a target is only one
of the web pages.  Second, lets create a body of the
`shimbun-index-url' method function using the `luna-define-method' form
in your `sb-foobar.el' file.  And make the user customizable variable
`shimbun-foobar-groups', which we will explain later(1).

     (defvar shimbun-foobar-url "http://www.foobar.net")

     (luna-define-method shimbun-index-url ((shimbun shimbun-foobar))
       shimbun-foobar-url)

     (defvar shimbun-foobar-groups '("news"))

   After you create a body of the `shimbun-index-url' method, the
`shimbun-headers' method can get a web page source since the
`shimbun.el' module already has the default `shimbun-headers' method.
After the `shimbun-headers' method gets a web page source, it calls the
`shimbun-get-headers' method to gather headers information.  As the
`shimbun.el' module does not have the `shimbun-get-headers' method, you
have to create it in your `sb-foobar.el' file.

   Now look carefully in the page source and create the
`shimbun-get-headers' method in your `sb-foobar.el' file.

   Create a regular expression that can gather headers information.
Minimally necessary information are subject, date, author, URL and
`message-id' of an article.  They are used in MUA as Subject, Date,
From, Xref and Message-ID.

   If you want to make an article from a line in a web page source,
like:

     <a href="053003.html">some talks on May 30(posted by Mikio &lt;foo@bar.net&gt;)</a>

use the following regexp:

     "<a href=\"\\(\\([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\\)[0-9][0-9]\\.html\\)\">\\([^<(]+\\)(posted by \\([^<]+\\))<\/a>"

You can get a value for Xref by `(match-string 1)'.  You can get a
value for Date by modifying a value of `(match-string 2)'.  Subject by
`(match-string 3)' and From from `(match-string 4)'.  You can modify
them further for showing additional information in MUA.

   If URL of an article is a relative path like above, use
`shimbun-expand-url' to expand it before putting information to header.
If each article doesn't have a each unique URLs (i.e. URL of headers
and URL of articles are just same), you have to ask Emacs to remember
body of an article when gathering headers information, For more detail
see the files `sb-palmfan.el', `sb-dennou.el' and `sb-tcup.el'.

   Sometimes you cannot identify Date information when gathering headers
information only from a web page source.  If so, leave it, just set a
null string, `""' to its value.  If you can identify Date only when you
see contents of an article, you can set it at that time by using
`shimbun-make-contents' method.  And you may use a fixed From for a web
site (e.x. "webmaster@foobar.net").

   Be careful when you build a message-id.  Make sure it has uniqueness
otherwise you may not be able to read some articles in the
`shimbun'(2).  Assure uniqueness by building message-id using date
information, a domain of the page and/or a part of URL of the page.
And use `@' but `:' as a part of message-id in order to display inline
images.  See RFC2387 and RFC822 for more detail.

   Put these information to header using function
`shimbun-create-header' of the `shimbun.el' module.

   A bare bone of `shimbun-get-headers' in your `sb-foobar.el' file is
as follows:

     (luna-define-method shimbun-get-headers ((shimbun shimbun-foobar)
                                              &optional range)
       (let ((regexp "....")
             subject from date id url headers)
         ...
         (catch 'stop
           (while (re-search-forward regexp nil t nil)
             ...
             (when (shimbun-search-id shimbun id)
               (throw 'stop nil))
             (push (shimbun-create-header
                    0 subject from date id "" 0 0 url)
                   headers)))
         headers))

Note that you can access `shimbun-foobar' instance via temporary
variable `shimbun' in the method.

   Now we will explain a user variable `shimbun-foobar-groups'.

   Assume that you have two groups of articles in
`http://www.foobar.net' and there are two different web pages for such
groups in where `shimbun' module gathers header information.  For
examples, there are what's new information of the web site in
`http://www.foobar.net/whatsnew/index.hmtl', and there are archive
lists of email messages posted to ML in
`http://www.foobar.net/ml/index.html'.  In such case you may want to
access the group by `shimbun' folders `foobar.whatsnew' and
`foobar.ml'.  If so, put the following S expressions to the
`sb-foobar.el' file.

     (defvar shimbun-foobar-url "http://www.foobar.net")

     (defvar shimbun-foobar-group-path-alist
       '(("whatsnew" . "/whatsnew/index.html")
         ("ml" . "/ml/index.html")))

     (defvar shimbun-foobar-groups
       (mapcar 'car shimbun-foobar-group-path-alist))

     (luna-define-method shimbun-index-url ((shimbun shimbun-foobar))
       (concat shimbun-foobar-url
               (cdr (assoc (shimbun-current-group-internal shimbun)
                           shimbun-foobar-group-path-alist))))

You can get the current group by using
`shimbun-current-group-internal'.  You can use it in
`shimbun-get-headers' method (or others) in order to change its
behavior in accordance with the current group.

   Each `shimbun' module needs at least one group.  There is not a
special rule for naming a group, but if you don't find out a good name,
use `news' or `main'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) At least one group is necessary for each `shimbun' module even
if you don't want it.

   (2) And more, you may not be able to read actual email messages from
someone when message-ids conflict!

9.6.3 Displaying an article
---------------------------

`shimbun-article' method defined in the `shimbun.el' module gets URL
from Xref information of header, get a web page source from the URL,
and call `shimbun-make-contents' in working buffer of the source.
Major job of `shimbun-make-contents' is to process such HTML.  Imagine
that a working buffer has a web page source of an article.
`shimbun-make-contents' defined in the `shimbun.el' module insert (i)
header information to top of the buffer, (ii) `<html>', `<body>' and
etc. right after the information, and (iii) `</body>' and `</html>' to
end of the buffer.  MUA displays an article as a HTML mail.

     Not only HTML articles, but also articles in the `text/plain'
     format can be generated.  *Note Making text/plain articles::.

   If you don't want to process an article, you don't have to define
`shimbun-make-contents' in the `sb-foobar.el' module.

   If you want to remove some part of a web page source of an article at
its top and its end, set regexp to `shimbun-foobar-content-start' that
matches content start and `shimbun-foobar-content-end' that matches
content end.

     (defvar shimbun-foobar-content-start "^<body>$")
     (defvar shimbun-foobar-content-end "^<\/body>$")

`shimbun-clear-contents', which is called by `shimbun-make-contents'
defined in the `shimbun.el' module, will remove HTML source from
`point-min' to `shimbun-foobar-content-start' and from
`shimbun-foobar-content-end' to `point-max' using the regexps.  Note
that it will not remove any HTML source when either of the regexp
searches fails.

   If you want to remove more unnecessary parts (e.x. advertisements)
diligently, define `shimbun-clear-contents' in your new `sb-foobar.el'
file as follows:

     (luna-define-method shimbun-clear-contents :around ((shimbun shimbun-foobar)
                                                         header)
       ;; cleaning up
       (while (re-search-forward "..." nil t nil)
         (delete-region (match-beginning 0) (match-end 0)))
       (luna-call-next-method))

For more details see `shimbun-make-contents' in the `sb-ibm-dev.el'
file.

   I said in the subsection of *note Getting web page and header
information:: that if each article doesn't have a each unique URLs you
have to ask Emacs to remember body of an article when gathering headers
information,  In such case you don't have to get a web page from URL of
Xref in `shimbun-article' method.  Just get texts from Emacs memories
and put them with pretty printing.  For more detail see definitions of
`shimbun-article' method of `sb-palmfan.el', `sb-dennou.el' or
`sb-tcup.el'.

9.6.4 Inheriting shimbun module
-------------------------------

There are some famous mailing list manager (or archiver).

   * Mailman The GNU Mailing List Manager, formerly called as
     `pipermail'.  See `http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/index.html'
     for detail.

   * MHonArc See `http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/mhonarc.html' for
     detail.

   * fml fml mailing list server/manager.  See
     `http://www.fml.org/software/fml/' for detail.

   * mailarc See `http://cvs.namazu.org/mailarc/' for detail.

   If you find out one of such mailing list managers' names in a web
page source when you analyze it in the step of *Note Getting web page
and header information::, you are very lucky(1).  The modules
`sb-mailman.el', `sb-mhonarc.el', `sb-fml.el' and `sb-mailarc.el' have
the `shimbun-get-headers' method, etc, already, when you write small
code that is not defined in such `shimbun' modules, your new
`sb-foobar.el' module works!

   If you use the `sb-mailman.el' module, write the following S
expressions to the top of the `sb-foobar.el' file:

     (require 'sb-mailman)
     (luna-define-class shimbun-foobar (shimbun-mailman) ())

Those above mean that `shimbun' module `shimbun-foobar' inherits
shimbun-mailman class(2) and methods defined in the `sb-mailman.el'
module will be used in `shimbun-foobar' by default.  You can overwrite
some of parent methods, if necessary.

   See the `sb-pilot-mailsync.el' file as a sample that uses the
`sb-mailman.el' module.  You can feel how easy to create a new
`shimbun' module by using such parent modules.

   Note that there are some localized version of such mailing list
manager, for examples, some of them show Date information in Japanese.
The modules `sb-mailman.el', `sb-mhonarc.el', `sb-fml.el' and
`sb-mailarc.el' assumes that mailing list managers are not localized.

   If you want to read via `shimbun' a web site that uses localized
mailing list manager, you may have to overwrite some methods in the
parent module.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Such mailing list managers often show their own name in an
archive list page

   (2) i.e. shimbun-mailman class is a parent class.

9.6.5 Making text/plain articles
--------------------------------

Even if the MUA is reinforced by emacs-w3m so as to be able to read HTML
articles, `text/plain' articles might be more convenient in some cases.
To make the `sb-foobar' module generate `text/plain' articles rather
than `text/html' articles, there are two ways to do that.

   * The one is to make the `sb-foobar' module inherit (*note
     Inheriting shimbun module::) the `sb-text' module.  Here's an
     example you may put in the beginning of the `sb-foobar' module.

          (require 'sb-text)
          (luna-define-class shimbun-foobar (shimbun-text) ())

     The `sb-text' module provides the `shimbun-make-contents' method
     which generates the articles in the `text/plain' format.  This
     will be useful for the `shimbun' modules handling the web sites
     which put up only text articles.

   * The other is to set the `shimbun-foobar-prefer-text-plain' variable
     to non-`nil'.  This makes the `shimbun-make-contents' method
     generate the articles in the `text/plain' format (actually, it uses
     the functions provided by the `sb-text' module).  Note that this is
     effective only to the modules which inherit the default
     `shimbun-make-contents' method (especially the modules which
     inherit the `sb-text' module are not affected).  The advantage of
     this way is that users can easily switch `text/plain' articles and
     `text/html' articles.

     The default value for the `shimbun-foobar-prefer-text-plain'
     variable is `nil' if it is not defined.  So, it defaults to `nil'
     in every `shimbun' module except for the modules `sb-asahi.el' and
     `sb-yomiuri.el'.

     In addition, you can use the variables
     `shimbun-foobar-text-content-start' and
     `shimbun-foobar-text-content-end' instead of
     `shimbun-foobar-content-start' and `shimbun-foobar-content-end' to
     extract significant text in web pages (*note Displaying an
     article::).  If the formers are not defined, those values default
     to the latter values.

Whichever the ways you use, you should note that the `text/plain'
articles cannot contain images, links, etc.

9.6.6 Zenkaku to hankaku conversion
-----------------------------------

"Zenkaku" or "zenkaku character(s)" is a term commonly used to call
Japanese wide characters, and "hankaku" is an opposite term for
ordinary ASCII characters.  There is a complete set of zenkaku
characters corresponding to at least the ASCII character set.

   Some Japanese web sites tend to use zenkaku characters a lot, and
those articles might not necessarily be comfortable to read.  If you
feel so, you can use this feature that converts those zenkaku ASCII
characters into hankaku.  To do that, set the
`shimbun-foobar-japanese-hankaku' variable to `t'.  Where `foobar' is a
server name to which you subscribe for shimbun articles.  That is, you
have to use it per server.

   If you prefer to convert zenkaku to hankaku only in the body of
articles, use the value `body' instead of `t'.  Contrarily the value
`header' or `subject' specifies to perform it only in subjects.


File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Coding convention of Shimbun,  Prev: Zenkaku to hankaku conversion,  Up: Shimbun Basics

9.6.7 Coding convention of Shimbun
----------------------------------

   * You can use all functions defined in emacs-w3m in `shimbun.el'.

   * You can use no functions defined in emacs-w3m in `sb-*.el'.  If you
     want to use emacs-w3m functions in `sb-*.el', you must add their
     stubs to `shimbun.el'.

   * You must avoid file names that have already used in SpeedBar.
     Here is a list of file names used in `speedbar-0.14beta4'.

     sb-ant.el     sb-html.el    sb-info.el    sb-texinfo.el
     sb-gud.el     sb-image.el   sb-rmail.el   sb-w3.el

   * You should select file names which remind their referring WEB
     servers' URIs.  It is allowed to remove country parts (Ex.
     jp,de,uk,etc), organization parts (Ex. edu,com,org,net,etc) and
     redundant parts (Ex. www) if removing does not increase vagueness.

   * You should select group names in USENET style.  It means that small
     characters are preferred in group names, and that period(.)  is
     preferred as an delimiter to show hierarchical structure in groups.

10 Some knick-knacks using emacs-w3m
************************************

Here are some handy tips to use emacs-w3m with other Emacs facilities.

   * browse-url

     You can use emacs-w3m with the `browse-url' feature.  For instance,
     put the following lines in your `~/.emacs' file:

          (setq browse-url-browser-function 'w3m-browse-url)
          (global-set-key "\C-xm" 'browse-url-at-point)

     Emacs-w3m will now be invoked when you type the `C-x m' key on a
     string which looks like a URL in any Emacs buffer.  In addition,
     you can use emacs-w3m to preview an HTML file that you are just
     editing by typing the `C-c C-v' key (note that you need to use
     Emacs and the `html-mode' major mode to edit the HTML file).

     If you'd like to use another web browser than emacs-w3m when using
     the `C-x m' key when you are in an emacs-w3m buffer (who wants to
     do so?), add the following advice to `~/.emacs' file:

          (defadvice browse-url-at-point
            (around change-browse-url-browser-function activate)
            "Use Netscape only when it is invoked in an emacs-w3m buffer."
            (let ((browse-url-browser-function
                   (if (eq major-mode 'w3m-mode)
                       'browse-url-netscape
                     'w3m-browse-url)))
              ad-do-it))

   * dired

     You can use emacs-w3m to browse an HTML file in a `dired' buffer by
     typing the `C-x m' key.  Use the following settings in your
     `~/.emacs' file:

          (eval-after-load "dired"
            '(define-key dired-mode-map "\C-xm" 'dired-w3m-find-file))

          (defun dired-w3m-find-file ()
            (interactive)
            (require 'w3m)
            (let ((file (dired-get-filename)))
              (if (y-or-n-p (format "Use emacs-w3m to browse %s? "
                                    (file-name-nondirectory file)))
                  (w3m-find-file file))))

   * hnf-mode

     You can see the newest diary using emacs-w3m and the hyper nikki
     system.  Put the following lines in your `~/.emacs' file and type
     the `C-c C-b' key in an `hnf-mode' buffer:

          (defun w3m-hnf-browse-url-w3m (url &optional new-window)
            (interactive (browse-url-interactive-arg "URL: "))
            (save-selected-window
              (pop-to-buffer (get-buffer-create "*w3m*"))
              (w3m-browse-url url new-window)))
          (setq hnf-browse-url-browser-function #'w3m-hnf-browse-url-w3m)

   * Gnus

     You've mistaken the entrance if you are a Gnus user and this
     section is the first page you read in this Info.  See *note
     Hooking into MUAs:: first.

     By default, Gnus will not apply the treatment variables, for
     instance `gnus-treat-strip-banner', to `text/html' parts.  To have
     them applied to `text/html' parts automatically, there are two
     ways to do that:

          ;; Apply all the treatments to text/html parts.
          (eval-after-load "gnus-art"
            '(add-to-list 'gnus-article-treat-types "text/html"))

          ;; Apply a certain treatment to text/html parts.
          (setq gnus-treat-strip-banner '(or t (typep "text/html")))

     Also *Note Customizing Articles: (gnus)Customizing Articles, for
     details.

     In addition, the experimental code below is used to display
     `multipart/related' pictures.  The place might be something wrong.

          (eval-after-load "gnus-art"
            '(or (assoc "multipart/related" gnus-mime-multipart-functions)
                 (setq gnus-mime-multipart-functions
                       (cons
                        (cons
                         "multipart/related"
                         (byte-compile
                          (lambda (handle)
                            (gnus-mime-display-mixed (cdr handle)))))
                        gnus-mime-multipart-functions))))

   * yahtml-mode

     You can use emacs-w3m to preview an HTML file that just you are
     editing with the `yahtml-mode'.  Here is an example:

          (defadvice yahtml-browse-html
            (around w3m-yahtml-browse-html activate compile)
            (w3m-goto-url (ad-get-arg 0) t))

   * jisx0213

     You can use JIS X 0213 character set in Emacs using the `jis0213'
     module which is bundled in the Mule-UCS package.  Although the
     `decode-char' function is overridden by `mucs' (`jis0213' loads
     `mucs') and it stops working properly for the `ucs' coded
     character set, it has been reported that also to load the
     `unicode' module seems to solve the problem. The reason has not
     been made clear yet.  Here is an example for the `~/.emacs' file:

          (require 'unicode)
          (require 'un-define)
          (require 'jisx0213)

13 Companion packages you might need
************************************

Even though emacs-w3m provides a wealth of features, you may want to
check out the following external packages for even more usability:

   * w3m-type-ahead.el

     The w3m-type-ahead.el package provides "type ahead" searching,
     similar to the feature by the same name from Mozilla browsers.  It
     allows you to find anchors using an interface similar to isearch,
     but results are limited to anchors in the buffer.

     Download w3m-type-ahead.el from
     `http://alioth.debian.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=30594'.

   * newsticker.el

     newsticker.el that has been incorporated in Emacs 22 and greater
     is a rowse rss feeds and also atom feeds.  Here is a configuration
     example to use newsticker.el together with emacs-w3m (put it in
     the `~/.emacs' file):

          (require 'w3m-load)
          (setq newsticker-html-renderer 'w3m-region
                browse-url-browser-function 'w3m-browse-url)
