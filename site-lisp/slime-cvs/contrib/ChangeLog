2008-04-17  Gábor Melis <mega@retes.hu>

	* swank-fancy-inspector.lisp (inspect-slot-for-emacs):
	slime-read-object has been gone for a long time, replaced with
	slime-read-from-minibuffer.

2008-04-15  Marco Baringer  <mb@bese.it>

	* slime-indentation.el (cl-indent::line-number): new function.
	(cl-indent:indent-cond): Custom indentation method for cl:cond.
	(cl-indent-body-introducing-loop-macro-keyword)
	(cl-indent-indented-loop-macro-keyword): more loop keywords.
	(cl-indent-loop-advance-past-keyword-on-line): deal with comments
	after loop keywords.
	(#'define-cl-indent): Fix indentation of handler-case; give cond
	it's custom indentation method; change indentation of defclass;
	add methods for do-all-symbols, do-symbols, do-external-symbols,
	restart-case, with-accessors, with-compilation-unit,
	with-hash-table-iterator, with-output-to-string,
	with-input-from-string, with-open-file, with-open-stream,
	with-package-iterator, with-simple-restart, with-slots.

	* slime-presentations.lisp: 
	(slime-maybe-M-.-presentation-at-point): Renamed to
	`slime-edit-presentation'. Now makes sure to decline if user gave
	a name explicitly. 

2008-03-24  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* swank-kawa.scm: Save stacktraces with locals on throw events.
	This is quite costly but makes debugging easier.

2008-03-14  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-fancy-inspector.lisp (add-slots-for-inspector): Remove
	IGNORE declaration of non-existing argument.

2008-03-14  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-fuzzy.lisp (fuzzy-convert-matching-for-emacs): Return a
	string representation of the classifications rather than the
	classifications themselves. (Notice this propagates up to (and
	consequently changes the return value of) the RPC function
	FUZZY-COMPLETIONS. (incompatible api change.)  

	Rationale: The number of supported classification can be changed
	without having to adapt its display at the client.

	* slime-fuzzy.lisp (slime-fuzzy-insert-completion-choice):
	(slime-fuzzy-fill-completions-buffer): Adapted to API change.

2008-03-14  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-fancy-inspector.lisp (make-symbols-listing :classification):
	Add support for typespec and constant classification; don't
	silently ignore symbols that can't be usefully classified, but
	group them under "MISC".

2008-03-14  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Move filename translation code to contrib.

	* slime-tramp.el (slime-find-filename-translators)
	(slime-filename-translations): Move from slime.el.

	method only if the backend hasn't defined one.
	(inspect-function): New function.

2008-03-02  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-mit-scheme.scm: New file.

2008-02-21  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	Having the `slime-presentations' contrib enabled, (princ 10)
	resulted in "1010" rather than "10\n10". (This also caused a
	regression in the `repl-test' test case.)
	
	* swank-presentations.lisp (present-repl-results): Emit fresh-line
	as the original SEND-REPL-RESULTS-TO-EMACS does.

	Update Kawa backend to the changed inspector protocol.

	* swank-kawa.scm (inspect-object): Return a list (content len

	* slime-xref-browser.el (slime-expand-class-node)
	(slime-browse-classes, slime-expand-xrefs, slime-browse-xrefs):
	:dynargs is obsolete, it is now called :expander.

	* swank-fancy-inspector.lisp (emacs-inspect pathname): Fix it
	again.

	* slime-fancy-inspector.el: Use slime-require.

	* slime-fancy.el: slime-fancy-inspector-init no longer exists, so
	don't call it.  Once loaded, it's also no longer possible to turn
	the fancy inspector off.

2008-02-04  Marco Baringer  <mb@bese.it>

	* swank-presentation-streams.lisp (presenting-object-1): Add
	declare special *record-repl-results* to silence compiler
	warnings.

	* swank-arglists.lisp (arglist-dispatch): Specialize operator-type
	so openmcl doesn't warn about unused arguments.
	(arglist-dispatch): add declare ignore form.

2008-02-04  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Move some functions to swank-arglist.lisp.

	* swank-arglist.lisp (length=, ensure-list, recursively-empty-p)

	contrib infrastructure. Fix bug in &rest.

	* swank-indentation.lisp: Allow an application runnig under slime

2008-01-10  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-parse.lisp (slime-incomplete-form-at-point): Hopefully
	better fix than before.
	
2008-01-10  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	Add keyboard commands (starting with C-c C-v) and a top-level menu
	for presentation-related commands.  Add a command (C-c C-v M-o) to
	forget all objects associated with presentations, without
	clearing the REPL buffer.
	
	* slime-presentations.el
	(slime-presentation-around-or-before-point-or-error): New
	function.
	(slime-inspect-presentation): New function, factored out from

	from slime-copy-presentation-at-mouse.

	slime-copy-presentation-at-mouse; use the new function
	slime-copy-presentation-to-repl. 
	(slime-copy-presentation-at-point-to-repl): New command.
	(slime-copy-presentation-to-kill-ring): New function, factored
	out from slime-copy-presentation-at-mouse-to-kill-ring.
	(slime-copy-presentation-at-point-to-kill-ring): New command.

2008-01-10  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-parse.lisp (slime-incomplete-form-at-point): Take the
	arglist index the user's point is located at correctly into
	account. Previously `C-c C-s' on `(defun |foo' would have inserted
        `args body...)', now it inserts `name args body...)'
	
2008-01-10  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-arglists.lisp (read-form-spec): Changed "cons" clause to
	"list" clause in etypecase. Fix for error on arglist display on
	`(declare (ftype (|)))', | being point.
	
2008-01-10  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-fuzzy.el (slime-fuzzy-completion-time-limit-in-msec):
	Update docstring: Its value isn't rounded to nearest second, but
	is really interpreted as msecs.

	* swank-fuzzy.el: Updated some comments.
	(fuzzy-generate-matchings): Sort package matchings before
	traversal, such that they're traversed in the order of their
	score. (Important when time limit exhausts during traversal.)
	
2008-01-09  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	Restore support for Scheme programs that was removed from core
	SLIME on 2007-09-19, as a "slime-scheme" contrib.
	
	* slime-scheme.el: New file.

2007-12-30  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-arglists.lisp: Fix for `(cerror "FOO" 'type-error ...)'

	(*arglist-dummy*): Removed.
	(arglist-dummy): New structure. Wrapper around whatever could not
	be reliably read. The clue is that its printing function does only
	print the object this structure contains.
	(read-conversatively-for-autodoc): Return such a structure if
	conversative reading fails.

2007-11-27  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-arglists.lisp (arglist-dispatch 'defmethod): Use
	VALID-FUNCTION-NAME-P. Fixes error on certain `(defmethod (setf	...))'
	forms.
	
2007-11-27  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-arglists.lisp (print-arglist): Print initforms in &optional and
	&key lambda list specifiers as if by PRIN1 instead of PRINC.
	Reported by Michael Weber.
	
2007-11-24  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* slime-fuzzy.el: Use slime-require instead of a connected-hook.

2007-11-20  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* swank-fancy-inspector.lisp (inspect-for-emacs function t): Don't
	specialize the second argument, so that backend methods take
	precedence.  Reported by Maciej Katafiasz.

2007-10-24  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-arglist.lisp (decode-arglist): Fix incompatibility with
	ACL's modern reader mode. Thanks to Andreas Fuchs for stumbling
	over this.

2007-10-22  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-arglist.lisp (read-softly): Renamed to
	READ-SOFTLY-FROM-STRING and moved to `swank.lisp'.
	(unintern-in-home-package): Moved to `swank.lisp'.

2007-10-01  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-autdoc.el (slime-autodoc-message-ok-p): Don't display an
	arglist when the minibuffer is active.

2007-10-01  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-typeout-frame.el: Messages in the typeout frame were too
	easily overwritten by `slime-autodoc'. Fix that.
	Reported by Geoff Wozniak.
	
	(slime-typeout-message-aux): Split out from `slime-typeout-message'.
	(slime-typeout-message): Wrapper around it. Additionally disable
	the autodoc timer temporarily.

2007-09-30  Geoff Wozniak  <geoff@wozniak.ca>

	* slime-typeout-frame.el (slime-typeout-frame-init): Fix quoted
	FUNCTION forms in literal.

2007-09-28  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* README: Updated.

	* slime-fancy.el: `slime-highlighting-edits' is not enabled by
	default anymore, as its functionality is controversial, and it's
	easier to explicitly enable it than to disable it once it got
	globally activated. Better to be conservative.

	* slime-fancy.el: Not only load, but also enable `slime-scratch'.

2007-09-21  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* slime-asdf.el (slime-asdf-init, slime-asdf-unload): Fix typos.
	Reported by Ariel Badichi.

2007-09-20  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Separate loading from initialization for many contribs.

	* slime-asdf.el
	* slime-autodoc.el
	* slime-banner.el
	* slime-c-p-c.el
	* slime-editing-commands.el
	* slime-fancy-inspector.el
	* slime-fuzzy.el
	* slime-highlight-edits.el
	* slime-presentations.el
	* slime-references.el
	* slime-scratch.el
	* slime-typeout-frame.el
	* swank-fancy-inspector.lisp

	* slime-fancy.el: As an exception, call the respective init
	function when loading.

2007-09-19  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* slime-c-p-c.el (slime-complete-symbol*-fancy): Move defcustom
	from slime.el to contrib/slime-c-p-c.el.

2007-09-16  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-fuzzy.lisp: Fix regression that would not allow to fuzzy
	complete on inputs without package qualifier like "app".
	Reported by David J. Neu.
	
	(%make-duplicate-symbols-filter): Return complement.
	(fuzzy-find-matching-symbols): Treat passed filter as an acceptor
	predicate, not as a rejector.
	
2007-09-15  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Add the necessary hooks when loading some contribs, so that those
	contribs can be easily loaded with slime-setup.

	* slime-highlight-edits.el (slime-highlight-edits-mode-on): New
	function.  Add this to slime-mode-hook by default.

	* slime-autodoc.el (slime-use-autodoc-mode): Change default to t.

2007-09-15  Ariel Badichi <abadichi@bezeqint.net>

	* swank-fancy-inspector.lisp (inspect-for-emacs package): When
        inspecting a package, the links in the use list and the used-by
        list lead to inspecting package names, rather than the packages
        themselves. Fix that.

2007-09-15  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-parse.el: Fix extended arglist display on misbalanced
	expressions like `(defun foo | ... (defun bar () 'bar)'
	Reported by Ariel Badichi.
	
	(slime-inside-string-p): Use `beginning-of-defun' directly than
	relying on `slime-region-for-defun-at-point' (as this one uses
	`end-of-defun' which signals an error on misbalanced expressions.)

2007-09-15  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-fuzzy.lisp: Code reorganization and cleanup; making it
	compute less and couple of other minor issues fixed on the
	way. Thanks to Stelian Ionescu for testing and providing feedback!

	(defstruct fuzzy-matching): New `package-name' slot.
	(make-fuzzy-matching): Updated for new slot.
	(format-completion-result): Renamed to `fuzzy-format-matching'.
	(%fuzzy-extract-matching-info): Helper for `fuzzy-format-matching'.

	(fuzzy-completion-set): Convert the matchings after they got
	truncated to the passed completion-set limit from Emacs.
	I.e. `slime-fuzzy-completion-limit' This means a huge
	computational reduction.

	(fuzzy-create-completion-set): Renamed to `fuzzy-generate-matchings'.
	(fuzzy-generate-matchings): Returns the fuzzy matchings
	themselves, do not yet convert them for Emacs. Do not perform two
	sorts on the generated matchings (first alphabetically, then per
	score), but just one with an appropriate predicate that sorts per
	score, unless matchings are equal, then sort alphabetically. Prune
	matchings with symbols which are found in a differenta package
	than their home package when the home package is among the matched
	packages. Try to take the time needed to sort the generated
	matchings into account for the time-limit.
	(%guess-sort-duration): Helper. 
	Tries to guess how long the sort will take.
	(%make-duplicate-symbols-filter): Helper. 
	Used for pruning of matchings.
	(fuzzy-matching-greaterp): New testing predicate for sorting.

	(fuzzy-find-matching-symbols): Now takes a :filter keyarg; only
	considers symbols that pass through the filter.
	(fuzzy-find-matching-packages): Do not return matchings for all
	nicknames of package, but just the one that matches best.	
	
2007-09-11  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-editing-commands.el: Automatically bind the editing
	commands when this module is required. (Previously, one had to
	enable them explicitly, but this is inconsistent to, for instance,
	the `slime-c-p-c' module which also sets up its bindings
	automatically.)
	(slime-bind-editing-commands): Renamed to `slime-editing-commands-init'.
	(slime-editing-commands-init): Evaluated at toplevel.

2007-09-11  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-parse.el (slime-enclosing-form-specs): Now also works even
	when point is inside a string.
	(slime-inside-string-p): New function.
	(slime-beginning-of-string): New function.

2007-09-11  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-arglist.lisp (read-conversatively-for-autodoc): Also parse
	quoted symbols explicitly. This fixed extended arglist display for
	`(make-instance 'foo'. Reported by: Johannes Groedem.

2007-09-11  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-fancy.el: Require `slime-references'.
	
2007-09-10  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* slime-parse.el (slime-cl-symbol-name, slime-cl-symbol-package):
	Move from slime.el to contrib/slime-parse.el.

2007-09-10  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* inferior-slime.el: Fix installation comment.

2007-09-10  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Fix some of the bugs introduced with the last change.
	
	* slime-references.el (sldb-reference-face): Add missing quote.
	(sldb-reference-properties): We are lucky and can use keywords
	instead of strings.
	(sldb-maybe-insert-references): Insert newlines differently.
	
2007-09-10  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Move SBCL doc references to contrib.

	* slime-references.el: New file.

2007-09-10  Attila Lendvai  <attila.lendvai@gmail.com>

	* slime-fuzzy.el: Fixed some race condition that prevented a
	proper closing of the *Fuzzy Completions* buffer in some
	circumstances.
	
	(slime-fuzzy-save-window-configuration): Removed. Hooking up
	`window-configuration-change-hook' via `run-with-timer' was racy
	and lead to this bug; we now set the hook explicitely at the
	necessary place instead.
	(slime-fuzzy-window-configuration-change-add-hook): Removed.
	(slime-fuzzy-choices-buffer): Explicitly save the
	window-configuration, and explicitly set the hook.
	(slime-fuzzy-done): Explicitely remove the hook.

2007-09-10  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-parse.el (slime-cl-symbol-name, slime-cl-symbol-package):
	Moved back into slime.el.

2007-09-08  Stelian Ionescu  <sionescu@common-lisp.net>

	* slime-banner.el: Fixed typo to provide `slime-banner', not
	`slime-startup-animation'.

2007-09-06  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* slime-presentations.el (slime-presentation-write): Use case, not
	ecase, for dispatching targets.  Should fix XEmacs compatibility.
	Reported by Steven E. Harris.

2007-09-05  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-c-p-c.el: This file incorrectly provided the module
	`:swank-compound-prefix'; changed that to `:swank-c-p-c'. 

	This gets rid off the nasty redefinition warnings that were
	previously signalled when loading SWANK with SBCL.

	* swank-arglist.lisp (arglist-for-echo-area): Locally declare
	`*arglist-pprint-bindings*' to be special, as the variable is
	defined later in the file. (Gets rid of warnings during loading.)

2007-09-05  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-c-p-c.el (slime-c-p-c-init): Bind `slime-complete-form' to
	`C-c C-s' in `slime-repl-mode-map'.
	
2007-09-05  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	Added extended arglist display for DECLAIM and PROCLAIM.
	
	* slime-parse.el (slime-extended-operator-name-parser-alist): Added
	entries for "DECLAIM", and "PROCLAIM".
	(slime-parse-extended-operator/declare): Provide information about
	the operator the arglist is requested for.
	(slime-make-form-spec-from-string): Fixed for "()" as input.
	
	* swank-arglists.lisp (valid-operator-symbol-p): Explicitly allow
	the symbol 'DECLARE.
	(arglist-dispatch): New method for `DECLARE'. We have to catch
	this explicitly, as DECLARE doesn't have an arglist (in the
	`swank-backend:arglist' sense.)
	(*arglist-pprint-bindings*): New variable. Splitted out from
	`decoded-arglist-to-string'.
	(decoded-arglist-to-string): Use `*arglist-pprint-bindings*'.

	(parse-first-valid-form-spec): Rewritten, because function
	signature had to be changed: doesn't take arg-indices anymore;
	returns position of first valid spec as second value to remedy.
	(arglist-for-echo-area): Accomodated to new signature of
	`parse-first-valid-form-spec'; now searchs for contextual
	declaration operator name, to prefix a declaration arglist by
	"declare", "declaim", or "proclaim" depending on what was used at
	user's point in Slime. Use `*arglist-pprint-bindings*' for
	printing the found declaration operator name.
	(%find-declaration-operator): New helper to do this search.
	(completions-for-keyword): Accomodated to new signature of
	`parse-first-valid-form-spec'. Also fixed to correctly provide
	keyword completions in nested expressions like:

	   `(defun foo (x)
	      (let ((bar 'quux))
	        (with-open-file (s f :|'    [`|' being point]
	
2007-09-04  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* swank-arglists.lisp (parse-first-valid-form-spec): Rewrite it for
	ABCL.

	workaround for XEmacs issues.

2007-09-04  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Move asdf support to contrib:

	* slime-asdf.el: New file.

	* swank-asdf.lisp: New file
	(operate-on-system, asdf-central-registry)
	(list-all-systems-known-to-asdf): Use the asdf package in the
	source code, i.e. write asdf:operate instead of
	 (find-symbol "OPERATE" "ASDF").

2007-09-04  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* slime-tramp.el: New file.
	* slime-banner.el: New file.
	* inferior-slime.el: New file.

2007-09-01  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* slime-fancy.el: New meta-contrib.

2007-09-01  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* slime-presentations.el (slime-dispatch-presentation-event):
	Explicitly return t to indicate the events have been handled,
	rather than relying on the return values of the called functions.

2007-09-01  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* slime-typeout-frame.el (slime-typeout-autodoc-message): Fix for
	messages that contain "%".  Reported by Martin Simmons.

2007-09-01  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	Makes `slime-complete-form' work on `(eval-when |'; doesn't work
	on `(eval-when (|' yet.
	
	* slime-parse.el (slime-parse-sexp-at-point): Guard against
	`(char-after)' being NIL at end of buffer (especially important
	for use on the REPL.)

	* swank-arglist.lisp (arglist-dispatch 'eval-when): Fix typo.
	(print-decoded-arglist-as-template): Print keywords with PRIN1.
	
2007-08-31  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	Added extended arglist display for EVAL-WHEN, viz:

	  (eval-when (&any :compile-toplevel :load-toplevel :execute) &body body)

	Notice that completion works as expected on these keywords.

	Die, EVAL-ALWAYS, die!

	* swank-arglist (arglist-dispatch): New method for EVAL-WHEN.
	(print-arglist): Print keywords with PRIN1 rather than PRINC,
	to get a result as shown above for the EVAL-WHEN case.
	(completions-for-keyword): Add support for &ANY args.	 
	
2007-08-31  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-arglist.lisp: Do not fall back to READ when interpreting
	the ``raw form specs'' comming from Slime's autodoc stuff. But
	still do so for those comming from `slime-complete-form'.

	(unintern-in-home-package): New.

	(*arglist-dummy*): New.
	(read-conversatively-for-autodoc): New function. Doesn't READ
	anything that comes from Slime's autodoc. Just tries to parse
	symbols. If that's not successfull, returns the dummy placeholder
	datum stored in `*arglist-dummy*'.
	(arglist-for-echo-area): Parse form-specs using
	`read-conversatively-for-autodoc'. Use `unintern-in-home-package'.

	(read-softly): New. Splitted out from `read-form-spec'. This
	function tries to keep track of newly interned functions before
	READing.
	(read-form-spec): Parametrized to take a function to read the
	elements of the passed ``raw form spec''. Uses `read-softly' as
	default reader.

	(complete-form, completions-for-keywords): 
	Use `unintern-in-home-package'.

	* slime-editing-commands.el: Add installation notes.

2007-08-31  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Move compound prefix completion and autodoc to contrib.
	Interdependencies made it almost necessary to move parsing code
	and editing commands in the same patch.

	* swank-c-p-c.el: New file.
	* slime-parse.el: New file.

	* slime-presentations.el (slime-last-output-target-id)
	(slime-output-target-to-marker, slime-output-target-marker)
	(slime-redirect-trace-output): Moved back into SLIME core.

	* swank-presentation-streams.lisp: Require swank-presentations.
	(present-repl-results-via-presentation-streams): New.
	(*send-repl-results-function*): Set this variable rather than
	overriding send-repl-results-to-emacs.

2007-08-28  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* slime-presentations.el (slime-clear-presentations): New
	function. Add it to slime-repl-clear-buffer-hook.

2007-08-28  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* swank-presentations.lisp (present-repl-results): Renamed from
	send-repl-results-to-emacs.

2007-08-28  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	Override core defun to mark up REPL results as presentations.
	
	* swank-presentations.lisp: New file.
	* slime-presentations.el: Load it.

	* slime-presentations.el (slime-presentation-write): Remove id
	argument.

	* slime-presentation-streams.el: Require slime-presentations contrib.

2007-08-27  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Move presentations to contrib. (ELisp part)

	* slime-presentations.el: New file.
	* slime-scratch.el (slime-scratch-buffer): Ignore presentations.

2007-08-24  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	Some fixes to the presentation-streams contrib.
	
	* swank-presentation-streams.lisp [sbcl]: Load the pretty-printer
	patch only at load time.  Add some trickery so that SBCL does not
	complain about the changed layout of the pretty-stream class.
	
	* swank-presentation-streams.lisp (slime-stream-p): Using special
	return values, indicate whether we are printing to the
	REPL-results stream, or a dedicated stream.
	(presentation-record): New slot "target".
	(presentation-start, presentation-end): Use it (rather than the
	global variable *use-dedicated-output-stream*) to decide whether
	to use the bridge protocol or the :presentation-start/-end
	protocol.  Also use it as the TARGET argument of
	:presentation-start/-end messages. 
	(presenting-object-1): Use the new return values of
	slime-stream-p.
	
	* swank-presentation-streams.lisp (slime-stream-p) [cmu]: Use the
	return value of slime-stream-p rather than the global variable
	*use-dedicated-output-stream* to decide whether printing through
	pretty streams is safe for the layout.

2007-08-24  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	Make the fancy "presentation streams" feature a contrib.
	Previously, it was only available if "present.lisp" was loaded
	manually. 
	
	* slime-presentation-streams.el: New file.
	* swank-presentation-streams.lisp: New file, moved here from
	../present.lisp

	Move Marco Baringer's inspector to contrib.

	* swank-fancy-inspector.lisp: New file. The only difference to the

	specialized to the new class `fancy-inspector'.
	(fancy-inspector): New class.

	* slime-fancy-inspector.el: New file.

2007-08-19  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>
