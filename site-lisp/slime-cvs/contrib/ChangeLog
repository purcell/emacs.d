	* slime-asdf.el (slime-asdf-init, slime-asdf-unload): Fix typos.
	Reported by Ariel Badichi.

2007-09-20  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Separate loading from initialization for many contribs.

	* slime-asdf.el
	* slime-autodoc.el
	* slime-banner.el
	* slime-c-p-c.el
	* slime-editing-commands.el
	* slime-fancy-inspector.el
	* slime-fuzzy.el
	* slime-highlight-edits.el
	* slime-presentations.el
	* slime-references.el
	* slime-scratch.el
	* slime-typeout-frame.el
	* swank-fancy-inspector.lisp

	* slime-fancy.el: As an exception, call the respective init
	function when loading.

2007-09-19  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* slime-c-p-c.el (slime-complete-symbol*-fancy): Move defcustom
	from slime.el to contrib/slime-c-p-c.el.

2007-09-16  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-fuzzy.lisp: Fix regression that would not allow to fuzzy
	complete on inputs without package qualifier like "app".
	Reported by David J. Neu.
	
	(%make-duplicate-symbols-filter): Return complement.
	(fuzzy-find-matching-symbols): Treat passed filter as an acceptor
	predicate, not as a rejector.
	
2007-09-15  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Add the necessary hooks when loading some contribs, so that those
	contribs can be easily loaded with slime-setup.

	* slime-highlight-edits.el (slime-highlight-edits-mode-on): New
	function.  Add this to slime-mode-hook by default.

	* slime-autodoc.el (slime-use-autodoc-mode): Change default to t.

2007-09-15  Ariel Badichi <abadichi@bezeqint.net>

	* swank-fancy-inspector.lisp (inspect-for-emacs package): When
        inspecting a package, the links in the use list and the used-by
        list lead to inspecting package names, rather than the packages
        themselves. Fix that.

2007-09-15  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-parse.el: Fix extended arglist display on misbalanced
	expressions like `(defun foo | ... (defun bar () 'bar)'
	Reported by Ariel Badichi.
	
	(slime-inside-string-p): Use `beginning-of-defun' directly than
	relying on `slime-region-for-defun-at-point' (as this one uses
	`end-of-defun' which signals an error on misbalanced expressions.)

2007-09-15  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-fuzzy.lisp: Code reorganization and cleanup; making it
	compute less and couple of other minor issues fixed on the
	way. Thanks to Stelian Ionescu for testing and providing feedback!

	(defstruct fuzzy-matching): New `package-name' slot.
	(make-fuzzy-matching): Updated for new slot.
	(format-completion-result): Renamed to `fuzzy-format-matching'.
	(%fuzzy-extract-matching-info): Helper for `fuzzy-format-matching'.

	(fuzzy-completion-set): Convert the matchings after they got
	truncated to the passed completion-set limit from Emacs.
	I.e. `slime-fuzzy-completion-limit' This means a huge
	computational reduction.

	(fuzzy-create-completion-set): Renamed to `fuzzy-generate-matchings'.
	(fuzzy-generate-matchings): Returns the fuzzy matchings
	themselves, do not yet convert them for Emacs. Do not perform two
	sorts on the generated matchings (first alphabetically, then per
	score), but just one with an appropriate predicate that sorts per
	score, unless matchings are equal, then sort alphabetically. Prune
	matchings with symbols which are found in a differenta package
	than their home package when the home package is among the matched
	packages. Try to take the time needed to sort the generated
	matchings into account for the time-limit.
	(%guess-sort-duration): Helper. 
	Tries to guess how long the sort will take.
	(%make-duplicate-symbols-filter): Helper. 
	Used for pruning of matchings.
	(fuzzy-matching-greaterp): New testing predicate for sorting.

	(fuzzy-find-matching-symbols): Now takes a :filter keyarg; only
	considers symbols that pass through the filter.
	(fuzzy-find-matching-packages): Do not return matchings for all
	nicknames of package, but just the one that matches best.	
	
2007-09-11  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-editing-commands.el: Automatically bind the editing
	commands when this module is required. (Previously, one had to
	enable them explicitly, but this is inconsistent to, for instance,
	the `slime-c-p-c' module which also sets up its bindings
	automatically.)
	(slime-bind-editing-commands): Renamed to `slime-editing-commands-init'.
	(slime-editing-commands-init): Evaluated at toplevel.

2007-09-11  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-parse.el (slime-enclosing-form-specs): Now also works even
	when point is inside a string.
	(slime-inside-string-p): New function.
	(slime-beginning-of-string): New function.

2007-09-11  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-arglist.lisp (read-conversatively-for-autodoc): Also parse
	quoted symbols explicitly. This fixed extended arglist display for
	`(make-instance 'foo'. Reported by: Johannes Groedem.

2007-09-11  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-fancy.el: Require `slime-references'.
	
2007-09-10  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* slime-parse.el (slime-cl-symbol-name, slime-cl-symbol-package):
	Move from slime.el to contrib/slime-parse.el.

2007-09-10  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* inferior-slime.el: Fix installation comment.

2007-09-10  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Fix some of the bugs introduced with the last change.
	
	* slime-references.el (sldb-reference-face): Add missing quote.
	(sldb-reference-properties): We are lucky and can use keywords
	instead of strings.
	(sldb-maybe-insert-references): Insert newlines differently.
	
2007-09-10  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Move SBCL doc references to contrib.

	* slime-references.el: New file.

2007-09-10  Attila Lendvai  <attila.lendvai@gmail.com>

	* slime-fuzzy.el: Fixed some race condition that prevented a
	proper closing of the *Fuzzy Completions* buffer in some
	circumstances.
	
	(slime-fuzzy-save-window-configuration): Removed. Hooking up
	`window-configuration-change-hook' via `run-with-timer' was racy
	and lead to this bug; we now set the hook explicitely at the
	necessary place instead.
	(slime-fuzzy-window-configuration-change-add-hook): Removed.
	(slime-fuzzy-choices-buffer): Explicitly save the
	window-configuration, and explicitly set the hook.
	(slime-fuzzy-done): Explicitely remove the hook.

2007-09-10  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-parse.el (slime-cl-symbol-name, slime-cl-symbol-package):
	Moved back into slime.el.

2007-09-08  Stelian Ionescu  <sionescu@common-lisp.net>

	* slime-banner.el: Fixed typo to provide `slime-banner', not
	`slime-startup-animation'.

2007-09-06  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* slime-presentations.el (slime-presentation-write): Use case, not
	ecase, for dispatching targets.  Should fix XEmacs compatibility.
	Reported by Steven E. Harris.

2007-09-05  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-c-p-c.el: This file incorrectly provided the module
	`:swank-compound-prefix'; changed that to `:swank-c-p-c'. 

	This gets rid off the nasty redefinition warnings that were
	previously signalled when loading SWANK with SBCL.

	* swank-arglist.lisp (arglist-for-echo-area): Locally declare
	`*arglist-pprint-bindings*' to be special, as the variable is
	defined later in the file. (Gets rid of warnings during loading.)

2007-09-05  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-c-p-c.el (slime-c-p-c-init): Bind `slime-complete-form' to
	`C-c C-s' in `slime-repl-mode-map'.
	
2007-09-05  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	Added extended arglist display for DECLAIM and PROCLAIM.
	
	* slime-parse.el (slime-extended-operator-name-parser-alist): Added
	entries for "DECLAIM", and "PROCLAIM".
	(slime-parse-extended-operator/declare): Provide information about
	the operator the arglist is requested for.
	(slime-make-form-spec-from-string): Fixed for "()" as input.
	
	* swank-arglists.lisp (valid-operator-symbol-p): Explicitly allow
	the symbol 'DECLARE.
	(arglist-dispatch): New method for `DECLARE'. We have to catch
	this explicitly, as DECLARE doesn't have an arglist (in the
	`swank-backend:arglist' sense.)
	(*arglist-pprint-bindings*): New variable. Splitted out from
	`decoded-arglist-to-string'.
	(decoded-arglist-to-string): Use `*arglist-pprint-bindings*'.

	(parse-first-valid-form-spec): Rewritten, because function
	signature had to be changed: doesn't take arg-indices anymore;
	returns position of first valid spec as second value to remedy.
	(arglist-for-echo-area): Accomodated to new signature of
	`parse-first-valid-form-spec'; now searchs for contextual
	declaration operator name, to prefix a declaration arglist by
	"declare", "declaim", or "proclaim" depending on what was used at
	user's point in Slime. Use `*arglist-pprint-bindings*' for
	printing the found declaration operator name.
	(%find-declaration-operator): New helper to do this search.
	(completions-for-keyword): Accomodated to new signature of
	`parse-first-valid-form-spec'. Also fixed to correctly provide
	keyword completions in nested expressions like:

	   `(defun foo (x)
	      (let ((bar 'quux))
	        (with-open-file (s f :|'    [`|' being point]
	
2007-09-04  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* swank-arglists.lisp (parse-first-valid-form-spec): Rewrite it for
	ABCL.

2007-09-04  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Some bug fixes for slime-complete-symbol*.
	Patches by Mr. Madhu <enometh@meer.net>

	* slime-c-p-c.el (slime-c-p-c-unambiguous-prefix-p): New variable.
	(slime-expand-abbreviations-and-complete): Use it. Also add a
	workaround for XEmacs issues.

2007-09-04  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Move asdf support to contrib:

	* slime-asdf.el: New file.

	* swank-asdf.lisp: New file
	(operate-on-system, asdf-central-registry)
	(list-all-systems-known-to-asdf): Use the asdf package in the
	source code, i.e. write asdf:operate instead of
	 (find-symbol "OPERATE" "ASDF").

2007-09-04  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* slime-tramp.el: New file.
	* slime-banner.el: New file.
	* inferior-slime.el: New file.

	* slime-fancy.el: New meta-contrib.

2007-09-01  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* slime-presentations.el (slime-dispatch-presentation-event):
	Explicitly return t to indicate the events have been handled,
	rather than relying on the return values of the called functions.

2007-09-01  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* slime-typeout-frame.el (slime-typeout-autodoc-message): Fix for
	messages that contain "%".  Reported by Martin Simmons.

2007-09-01  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	Makes `slime-complete-form' work on `(eval-when |'; doesn't work
	on `(eval-when (|' yet.
	
	* slime-parse.el (slime-parse-sexp-at-point): Guard against
	`(char-after)' being NIL at end of buffer (especially important
	for use on the REPL.)

	* swank-arglist.lisp (arglist-dispatch 'eval-when): Fix typo.
	(print-decoded-arglist-as-template): Print keywords with PRIN1.
	
2007-08-31  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	Added extended arglist display for EVAL-WHEN, viz:

	  (eval-when (&any :compile-toplevel :load-toplevel :execute) &body body)

	Notice that completion works as expected on these keywords.

	Die, EVAL-ALWAYS, die!

	* swank-arglist (arglist-dispatch): New method for EVAL-WHEN.
	(print-arglist): Print keywords with PRIN1 rather than PRINC,
	to get a result as shown above for the EVAL-WHEN case.
	(completions-for-keyword): Add support for &ANY args.	 
	
2007-08-31  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-arglist.lisp: Do not fall back to READ when interpreting
	the ``raw form specs'' comming from Slime's autodoc stuff. But
	still do so for those comming from `slime-complete-form'.

	(unintern-in-home-package): New.

	(*arglist-dummy*): New.
	(read-conversatively-for-autodoc): New function. Doesn't READ
	anything that comes from Slime's autodoc. Just tries to parse
	symbols. If that's not successfull, returns the dummy placeholder
	datum stored in `*arglist-dummy*'.
	(arglist-for-echo-area): Parse form-specs using
	`read-conversatively-for-autodoc'. Use `unintern-in-home-package'.

	(read-softly): New. Splitted out from `read-form-spec'. This
	function tries to keep track of newly interned functions before
	READing.
	(read-form-spec): Parametrized to take a function to read the
	elements of the passed ``raw form spec''. Uses `read-softly' as
	default reader.

	(complete-form, completions-for-keywords): 
	Use `unintern-in-home-package'.

2007-08-31  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	(slime-output-target-to-marker, slime-output-target-marker)
	(slime-redirect-trace-output): Moved back into SLIME core.

	* swank-presentation-streams.lisp: Require swank-presentations.
	(present-repl-results-via-presentation-streams): New.
	(*send-repl-results-function*): Set this variable rather than
	overriding send-repl-results-to-emacs.

2007-08-28  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* slime-presentations.el (slime-clear-presentations): New
	function. Add it to slime-repl-clear-buffer-hook.

2007-08-28  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	argument.

	* slime-presentation-streams.el: Require slime-presentations contrib.

2007-08-27  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Move presentations to contrib. (ELisp part)

	* slime-presentations.el: New file.
	* slime-scratch.el (slime-scratch-buffer): Ignore presentations.

2007-08-24  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	Some fixes to the presentation-streams contrib.
	
	* swank-presentation-streams.lisp [sbcl]: Load the pretty-printer
	patch only at load time.  Add some trickery so that SBCL does not
	complain about the changed layout of the pretty-stream class.
	
	* swank-presentation-streams.lisp (slime-stream-p): Using special
	return values, indicate whether we are printing to the
	REPL-results stream, or a dedicated stream.
	(presentation-record): New slot "target".
	(presentation-start, presentation-end): Use it (rather than the
	global variable *use-dedicated-output-stream*) to decide whether
	to use the bridge protocol or the :presentation-start/-end
	protocol.  Also use it as the TARGET argument of
	:presentation-start/-end messages. 
	(presenting-object-1): Use the new return values of
	slime-stream-p.
	
	* swank-presentation-streams.lisp (slime-stream-p) [cmu]: Use the
	return value of slime-stream-p rather than the global variable
	*use-dedicated-output-stream* to decide whether printing through
	pretty streams is safe for the layout.

2007-08-24  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	Make the fancy "presentation streams" feature a contrib.
	Previously, it was only available if "present.lisp" was loaded
	manually. 
	
	* slime-presentation-streams.el: New file.
	* swank-presentation-streams.lisp: New file, moved here from
