This chapter describes how to use applications enabled by semantic.
Many of these come with semantic, but others are distributed apart from
semantic.

For basics of configuring semantic and the parts that go into it read

1 speedbar
**********

Speedbar supports the display of tags through the Semantic parser.  To
use this utility, add a line like this to your `.emacs' file:

     (add-hook 'speedbar-load-hook (lambda () (require 'semantic-sb)))

or you can simply add:

     (require 'semantic-sb)

Once installed, speedbar will use semantic to find tags, and will
display them appropriately.  Tags from semantic will have additional
details which can be seen, such as return type, or arguments to
functions.

If you use `semantic-load.el', you do not need to add the above lines
in your `.emacs' file.

Two additional speedbar modes are described in *Note Speedbar Analysis::

2 ECB
*****

From the ECB Website: `http://ecb.sourceforge.net':

     ECB is a source code browser for Emacs. It is a global minor-mode
     which displays a couple of windows that can be used to browse
     directories, files and file-contents like methods and variables.


File: semantic-user.info,  Node: imenu,  Next: senator,  Prev: ECB,  Up: Top

3 imenu
*******

There is special support for creating Imenu entries using semantic.
This is a highly customizable tool which can create specialized menu
systems for navigating your source file.

By default, each language that wants special imenu support will set
itself up for it.  To setup imenu for your buffers, use this command in
your `.emacs' file:

     (add-hook 'semantic-init-hooks (lambda ()
                                    	   (imenu-add-to-menubar "TAGS")))

Also supported is "which-func-mode".  This usually uses imenu tags to
show the current function.  The semantic support for this function uses
overlays, which is much faster.

If you use `semantic-load.el', you do not need to add the above lines
in your `.emacs' file.

You can customize imenu with the following options:

 -- Option: semantic-imenu-summary-function
     Function to use when creating items in Imenu.  Some useful
     functions are found in `semantic-format-tag-functions'.

 -- Option: semantic-imenu-bucketize-file
     Non-`nil' if tags in a file are to be grouped into buckets.

 -- Option: semantic-imenu-buckets-to-submenu
     Non-`nil' if buckets of tags are to be turned into submenus.  This
     option is ignored if `semantic-imenu-bucketize-file' is nil.

 -- Option: semantic-imenu-expand-type-members
     Non-`nil' if types should have submenus with members in them.

 -- Option: semantic-imenu-bucketize-type-members
     Non-`nil' if members of a type should be grouped into buckets.
     `nil' means to keep them in the same order.  Overridden to `nil'
     if `semantic-imenu-bucketize-file' is nil.

 -- Option: semantic-imenu-sort-bucket-function
     Function to use when sorting tags in the buckets of functions.
     See "semantic-bucketize" and the FILTER argument for more details
     on this function.

 -- Option: semantic-imenu-index-directory
     Non `nil' to index the entire directory for tags.  Doesn't
     actually parse the entire directory, but displays tags for all
     files currently listed in the current Semantic database.  This
     variable has no meaning if semanticdb is not active.

 -- Option: semantic-imenu-auto-rebuild-directory-indexes
     If non-`nil' automatically rebuild directory index imenus.  That
     is when a directory index imenu is updated, automatically rebuild
     other buffer local ones based on the same semanticdb.

When adding support to a language, this variable may need to be set:

 -- Variable: semantic-imenu-expandable-tag-classes
     List of expandable tag classes.  Tags of those classes will be
     given submenu with children.  By default, a `type' has interesting
     children.  In Texinfo, however, a `section' has interesting
     children.

4 senator
*********

Senator stands for SEmantic NAvigaTOR and was written by David Ponce.

This library defines commands and a minor mode to navigate and manage
semantic language tags in the current buffer.

4.1 Commands
============

The following user level commands are provided by Senator.

4.1.1 Navigation
----------------

 -- Function: senator-next-tag
     Navigate to the next Semantic tag.  Return the tag or `nil' if at
     end of buffer.

 -- Function: senator-previous-tag
     Navigate to the previous Semantic tag.  Return the tag or `nil' if
     at beginning of buffer.

 -- Function: senator-jump
     Jump to the semantic symbol SYM.

     If optional IN-CONTEXT is non-`nil' jump in the local type's
     context (see function "senator-current-type-context").  If optional
     NO-DEFAULT is non-`nil' do not provide a default value.

     When called interactively you can combine the IN-CONTEXT and
     NO-DEFAULT switches like this:

     - `C-u'       IN-CONTEXT.  - `C-u' -     NO-DEFAULT.  - `C-u'
     `C-u'   IN-CONTEXT + NO-DEFAULT.

4.1.2 Searching
---------------

Searching using senator mode restricts the search only to the
definition text, such as the name of the functions or variables in a
given buffer.

 -- Command: senator-isearch-toggle-semantic-mode
     Toggle semantic searching on or off in isearch mode.  `C-c , i'
     toggle semantic searching.

 -- Command: senator-search-forward what &optional bound noerror count
 -- Command: senator-search-backward what &optional bound noerror count
     Search semantic tags forward or backward from point for string
     WHAT.  Set point to the end of the occurrence found, and return
     point.  See "search-forward" for details and the meaning of BOUND
     NOERROR and COUNT.  COUNT is just ignored in the current
     implementation.

 -- Command: re-search-forward regex
 -- Command: re-search-backward regex
     Search forward and backward for a token matching the regular
     expression REGEX.

 -- Command: word-search-forward word
 -- Command: word-search-backward word
     Search forward and backward for a token whose name matches WORD.

4.1.3 Completion
----------------

Completion in senator scans all known definitions in the local file,
and uses that information to provide the completion.

 -- Command: senator-complete-symbol &optional cycle-once
     Complete the current symbol under point.  If optional argument
     CYCLE-ONCE is non-`nil', only cycle through the list of
     completions once, doing nothing where there are no more matches.

 -- Command: senator-completion-menu-popup
     Popup a completion menu for the symbol at point.  The popup menu
     displays all of the possible completions for the symbol it was
     invoked on.  To automatically split large menus this function use
     "imenu-mouse-menu" to handle the popup menu.

4.1.4 Copy/Paste
----------------

Token Copy/Paste is a high level form of the typical copy yank used by
Emacs.  Copying a tag saves the meta-information related to the
function or item the cursor is currently in.  When that information is
yanked into a new buffer, the form of the text created is based on the
current status of the programming buffer.

For example, pasting a function into a different file results in a
function call template to be inserted.  In a Texinfo file, a @deffn is
created with documentation for that function or command.

 -- Command: senator-copy-tag
     Take the current tag, and place it in the tag ring.

 -- Command: senator-kill-tag
     Take the current tag, place it in the tag ring, and kill it.
     Killing the tag removes the text for that tag, and places it into
     the kill ring.  Retrieve that text with `C-y'.

 -- Command: senator-yank-tag
     Yank a tag from the tag ring.  The form the tag takes is different
     depending on where it is being yanked to.

 -- Command: senator-copy-tag-to-register register &optional kill-flag
     Copy the current tag into REGISTER.  Optional argument KILL-FLAG
     will delete the text of the tag to the kill ring.

For programmers, to provide specialized pasting, created an override
function for `insert-foreign-tag' (see *note (semantic-langdev)Writing
Parsers::.)

4.1.5 Minor Mode
----------------

 -- Command: senator-minor-mode
     Toggle the SEmantic NAvigaTOR key bindings in the current buffer.

     The following default key bindings are provided when semantic minor
     mode is enabled:

    <C-c , n>
          senator-next-tag

    <C-c , p>
          senator-previous-tag

    <C-c , i>
          senator-isearch-toggle-semantic-mode

    <C-c , j>
          (Lower case j) semantic-complete-jump-local

    <C-c , J>
          (Upper case J) semantic-complete-jump

    <C-c , TAB>
          senator-complete-symbol

    <C-c , SPC>
          senator-completion-menu-popup

    <C-c , C-y>
          senator-yank-tag

    <C-c , C-w>
          senator-kill-tag

    <C-c , M-w>
          senator-copy-tag

    <C-c , +>
          senator-unfold-tag

    <C-c , ->
          senator-fold-tag

4.2 Customization
=================

To enable the Senator keymap in all modes that support semantic parsing,
use this:

     (add-hook 'semantic-init-hooks 'senator-minor-mode)

If you use `semantic-load.el', you do not need to add the above lines
in your `.emacs' file.

To customize navigation around different types of tokens, use the
following variables:

 -- Option: senator-step-at-tag-classes
     List of tag classes where to step.  A tag class is a symbol like
     `'variable', `'function', `'type', or other.  If `nil' navigation
     steps at any tag found.  This is a buffer local variable.  It can
     be set in a mode hook to get a specific langage navigation.

 -- Option: senator-step-at-start-end-tag-classes
     List of tag classes where to step at start and end.  A tag class
     is a symbol like `'variable', `'function', `'type', or other.  If
     `nil', navigation only step at beginning of tags.  If `t', step at
     start and end of any tag where it is allowed to step.  Also,
     stepping at start and end of a tag prevent stepping inside its
     components.  This is a buffer local variable.  It can be set in a
     mode hook to get a specific langage navigation.

To have a mode specific customization, do something like this in a hook:

     (add-hook 'mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (setq senator-step-at-tag-classes '(function variable))
                 (setq senator-step-at-start-end-tag-classes '(function))
                 ))

This will cause navigation and search commands to stop only between
functions and variables, and to step at start and end of functions only.

5 Analyzer
**********

The semantic analyzer is a library tool that performs context analysis
and can derive useful information.

 -- Command: semantic-analyze-current-context position
     Analyze the current context at POSITION.  If called interactively,
     display interesting information about POSITION in a separate
     buffer.  Returns an object based on symbol
     "semantic-analyze-context".

While this can be used as a command, it is mostly useful while
debugging the analyzer, or tools using the return value.  Use the Emacs
command "describe-class" to learn more about using
`semantic-analyze-context'.

Another command that uses the analyzer context can derive a completion
list.

 -- Command: semantic-analyze-possible-completions context
     Return a list of semantic tags which are possible completions.
     CONTEXT is either a position (such as point), or a precalculated
     context.  Passing in a context is useful if the caller also needs
     to access parts of the analysis.  Completions run through the
     following filters:
    Elements currently in scope

    Constants currently in scope

    Elements match the `:prefix' in the CONTEXT.

    Type of the completion matches the type of the context.
          Context type matching can identify the following:

    No specific type

    Assignment into a variable of some type.

    Argument to a function with type constraints.
          When called interactively, displays the list of possible
          completions in a buffer.

File: semantic-user.info,  Node: Smart Completion,  Next: Smart Summary,  Up: Analyzer

5.1 Smart Completion
====================

The file `semantic-ia.el' contains two commands for performing smart
completion using the analysis library.  Analysis to calculate these
completions are done through the analyzer and completion mechanism.
These functions just provide commands that can be bound to key bindings.

 -- Command: semantic-ia-complete-symbol point
     Complete the current symbol at POINT.  Completion options are
     calculated with "semantic-analyze-possible-completions".

 -- Command: semantic-ia-complete-symbol-menu point
     Complete the current symbol via a menu based at POINT.  Completion
     options are calculated with
     "semantic-analyze-possible-completions".

 -- Command: semantic-ia-complete-tip point
     Pop up a tooltip for completion at POINT.

You can get smart completions or summary information to automatically
popup without explicitly pressing a key or running a function.

This is accomplished through the Idle Scheduler and related features.
See *Note Idle Scheduler:: for more on the Scheduler.

Completions are provided with `semantic-idle-completions-mode'.  See
*Note Idle Completions Mode::.


File: semantic-user.info,  Node: Smart Summary,  Next: Smart Jump,  Prev: Smart Completion,  Up: Analyzer

5.2 Smart Summary
=================

Aside from completion, the analyzer can also be used just to show a
summary of what is under point.  These routines will summarize the
symbol in question in different ways.

 -- Command: semantic-ia-show-summary point
     Display a summary for the symbol under POINT.

 -- Command: semantic-ia-show-doc point
     Display the code-level documentation for the symbol at POINT.

 -- Command: semantic-ia-describe-class typename
     Display as all known parts for the datatype TYPENAME.  If the type
     in question is a class, all methods and other accessible parts of
     the parent classes are displayed.

You can also get summaries to popup in idle time without having to
press a key to get the information.

This is accomplished through the Idle Scheduler and related features.
See *Note Idle Scheduler:: for more on the Scheduler.

Summaries are provided with `semantic-idle-summary-mode'.  See *Note
Idle Summary Mode::.


File: semantic-user.info,  Node: Smart Jump,  Next: Speedbar Analysis,  Prev: Smart Summary,  Up: Analyzer

5.3 Smart Jump
==============

If you are on a symbol in some code, you might want to jump directly to
it.  You can use `find-tag', but in complex C++ systems, you can spend
a lot of time pressing `C-h M-.' trying to find the specific instance
of some function.

The analyzer can pinpoint very closely to where you actually indent
based on code context.

 -- Command: semantic-ia-fast-jump point
     Jump to the tag referred to by the code at POINT.  Uses
     "semantic-analyze-current-context" output to identify an accurate
     origin of the code at point.


File: semantic-user.info,  Node: Speedbar Analysis,  Next: Smart Completion Debugging,  Prev: Smart Jump,  Up: Analyzer

5.4 Speedbar Analysis
=====================

The Analyzer output can be used through a speedbar interface.  This
interface lists details about the analysis, such as the current
function, local arguments and variables, details on the prefix (the
symbol the cursor is on), and a list of all possible completions.
Completions are specified in "semantic-analyze-possible-completions"
*Note Analyzer::.

Each entry can be jumped to by clicking on the name.  For strongly
typed languages, this means you will jump to the definition of the
variable, slot, or type definition.

In addition each entry has an <i> button.  Clicking on this will
display a summary of everything that is known about the variable or
type displayed on that line.

If you click on the name of a variable in the "Completions" menu, then
the text that was recently analyzed will be replaced with the name of
the token that was clicked on in speedbar.

 -- Command: semantic-speedbar-analysis
     Start Speedbar in semantic analysis mode.  The analyzer displays
     information about the current context, plus a smart list of
     possible completions.

You can also enter speedbar analyzer mode by selecting "Analyze" from
the "Display" menu item on speedbar's menu.


File: semantic-user.info,  Node: Smart Completion Debugging,  Prev: Speedbar Analysis,  Up: Analyzer

5.5 Smart Completion Debugging
==============================

If you think you've configured your system correctly, but semantic
still can't find a definition you are looking for, you may have run
into either a bug in semantic, an incomplete configuration, or somehow
gotten semantic's set of cached tables into a bad state.

This section was written with C/C++ in mind, but should be relevant for
any typed language.

5.6 Step 1: Check the context
=============================

The first thing to do is check the current context.  You can do this
with `M-x semantic-analyze-current-context'.  If you look at the Prefix
section, you should see a list of tags based on the text from under
point.  If it shows only a simple string, the Semantic was unable to
identify what the data type was.

The first item in the list of the prefix is the first lookup failure in
the chain, and that is the item to focus debugging effort on.  For more
on the analyzer, see *Note Analyzer::.

     Context Type: #<semantic-analyze-context context>
     Bounds: (182 . 185)
     Prefix: Foo* bar
             int bbb (const char* y)
     Prefix Types: class Foo {}
     --------
     -> Local Vars: int argc
                    char** argv

In the above example you can see that the prefix has two fully found
tags.  In the below example, the symbol "bbb" is incomplete, and could
not be found.

     Context Type: #<semantic-analyze-context context>
     Bounds: (182 . 184)
     Prefix: Foo* bar
             "bb"
     Prefix Classes: 'function
                     'variable
     Prefix Types: class Foo {}
     --------
     -> Local Vars: int argc
                    char** argv

5.7 Step 2 : Check your include path
====================================

Once you know what symbol can't be found, the next thing to check is
your include path.  Is the header or include file that has the
definitions you need actually in the list of headers semantic is
searching through?  To get a basic list, you can use `M-x
semanticdb-find-test-translate-path'.

This will give you a list of database tables (by name) that semantic
can find.  This list is in ADEBUG mode.  Use `SPC' to expand items to
see if the tag you are looking for is in there.

For C++, check to make sure that your project level include files are
in "quotes", and not in <angle brackets>.  Items in angle brackets are
system includes.

See *Note Semanticdb search debugging commands:: for more commands.

If items should be loaded but aren't, you may need to update the search
throttle.  See *Note Search Throttle::.

If you see some tables that have 0 tags in them, then you you may have
an incorrectly set throttle.

     *#<semanticdb-table main.cpp (4 tags DIRTY)>
     *#<semanticdb-table foo.hh (0 tags DIRTY)>

In the above example, semantic found `foo.hh', but there are 0 tags.
This may be because the throttle was set to not read in and parse files
that Emacs has not yet loaded in.  To fix this case, visit the file,
and let semantic parse and save the tags table.

5.8 Step 3: Check the local scope
=================================

If your data type is somehow abbreviated based on scope, such as from a
`using' statement, you will need to make sure that the symbol you want
is in the local scope.  Examine the scope with `M-x
semantic-calculate-scope'.  The scope structure is displayed in ADEBUG
mode, so use `SPC' to expand different elements and looking for your
symbol.

If your symbol should be in the scope, but you cannot find it, then you
may have found a language support bug in the local-variable parser, or
using statement parser.

Calling `M-x bovinte' should force a reset on the scope in case there
is merely some bad state.

      ] Name: Cache
      ] Class: #'semantic-scope-cache
      ] :table #<semanticdb-table testsubclass.cpp (13 tags DIRTY)>
      ] tag createMoose : class moose
      ] scopetypes 'nil
      ] parents #<TAG LIST: 1 entries>
      ] scope #<TAG LIST: 22 entries>
      ] fullscope #<TAG LIST: 23 entries>
      ] localvar #<TAG LIST: 6 entries>

In the above sample output, the `tag' slot specifies where within you
source this scope is relevant.  `Parents' should contain any in scope
parents, such as the class a method belongs to.  `Localvar' should
contain your local variables.  `Scope' should contain datatypes in
scope due to a `using' statement or the like.

5.9 Step 4: Check the typecache
===============================

For complex typed languages like C++, semantic creates a typecache, or
an optimized search table with all the various data types in it.
Elements in the typecache do not obey local scope.  It only contains
fully qualified names.  You can examine the typecache with `M-x
semanticdb-typecache-dump'.

If your data types are not in the typecache, there may be some parsing
error or other bug.  Calling `M-x bovinte' should force a reset on the
typecache in case there is merely some bad state.

     ]#<semanticdb-typecache /home/zappo/cedet/semantic/tests/testsubclass.cpp>
        ] Name: /home/zappo/cedet/semantic/tests/testsubclass.cpp
        ] Class: #'semanticdb-typecache
        ] filestream 'nil
        ] includestream #<TAG LIST: 84 entries>
        ] stream 'nil
        ] dependants 'nil

In the above example, the output of `M-x semanticdb-typecache-dump' was
expanded one level.  The `filestream' slot should contain datatypes in
the current file.  The `includestream' should contain all the datatypes
in all included header files.

The `dependants' slot will specify other files that depend on this one.

5.10 Step 5: Check the parser
=============================

Go to the location where your unfound tag should be.  You can call `M-x
bovinate', and see a dump of the raw tag structure.  To see a navigable
tree, use `M-x semantic-adebug-bovinate' instead.  You can then look to
make sure your tag has been properly parsed.

If it has not, then you may have found a parser bug.  To get a feel how
semantic treats your file, you can enable `M-x
global-semantic-show-unmatched-syntax-mode'.  It will underline syntax
it cannot parse in red.

If your type is not parsable, it could be for several reasons.

  1. Parser Incorrect Perhaps the parser needs to be fixed.

  2. C/C++ MACROs If there is a MACRO keyword used in the definition of
     the type, then you may need to update the
     `semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-map' to account for it.

6 SymRef - Symbol References
****************************

semantic can interfaces with external symbol reference tools, like GNU
Global and IDUtils.  The symref tool interface can use one of these
external tools to collect locations where different tags or symbols may
be used.

There are two main command into the symref system.  They are:

 -- Command: semantic-symref
     Find references to the current tag.  This command uses the
     currently configured references tool within the current project to
     find references to the current tag. The references are the
     organized by file and the name of the function they are used in.
     Display the references in"semantic-symref-results-mode"

 -- Command: semantic-symref-symbol sym
     Find references to the symbol SYM.  This command uses the
     currently configured references tool within the current project to
     find references to the input SYM. The references are the organized
     by file and the name of the function they are used in.  Display
     the references in"semantic-symref-results-mode"

The results are listed by file, then by tag within those files.  You
can expand tag hits to see the line of code a given match is on.  You
can jump to the matched file, tag, or line from this mode.

The type of external tool used for finding references determines the
kind of results found.  Each available tool, such as GNU Global, will
identify when it can be used.  If no such tool is available, then a
find/grep combination will be used instead.

For best results, install, and use GNU Global for your project.
semantic symref does not manage your GNU Global tables for you.  You
must manage those yourself.  The symref tool is not meant to replace
the standard grep-like interface available with GNU Global.  It is
meant to be a starting point for tools that can take advantage of
reference information.

To add support for a new tool, use semantic-symref-global.el as a
starting point.  Then update `semantic-symref-tool-alist' to allow the
new tool to be detected.

 -- Function: semantic-symref-tool-alist
     Alist of tools usable by "semantic-symref".  Each entry is of the
     form:    ( PREDICATE . KEY ) Where PREDICATE is a function that
     takes a directory name for the root of a project, and returns
     non-`nil' if the tool represented by KEY is supported.

     If no tools are supported, then `'grep' is assumed.

@TODO - This mode is supposed to be the starting point of refactoring
tools.  Doc those features here once they are written.

7 Document
**********

The document program uses semantic tag tables to aid in the creation of
texinfo documentation.  For example, the following is a code fragment
from `document.el' that comes with semantic:

     (defun document (&optional resetfile)
       "Document the function or variable the cursor is in.
     Optional argument RESETFILE is provided w/ universal argument.
     When non-nil, query for a new documentation file."
       ...
       )

While visiting `document.el', put the cursor somewhere within the
function shown above. Then type `M-x document'.  After asking for the
texinfo file name, which in this case is `semantic.texi', this will
update the texinfo documentation of the `document' function in that
file.  The result is that the following texinfo text will be either
created or updated in `user-guide.texi' file:

     @deffn Command document &optional resetfile
     Document the function or variable the cursor is in.
     Optional argument @var{RESETFILE} is provided w/ universal argument.
     When non-@code{nil}, query for a new documentation file.
     @end deffn

Note that the function name, arguments and documentation string is put
in the right place.  Within the doc-string, the function arguments are
marked with the @var command and the `nil' code fragment is marked with
@code command.  This example provides just a glimpse of what is
possible with the syntactic information provided by semantic.

The main entry point for the documentation generator are the following
commands:

 -- Command: document &optional resetfile
     Document the function or variable the cursor is in.  Optional
     argument RESETFILE is provided w/ universal argument.  When
     non-`nil', query for a new documentation file.

 -- Command: document-inline
     Document the current function with an inline comment.

 -- Command: document-insert-defun-comment tag buffer
     Insert mode-comment documentation about TAG from BUFFER.

 -- Command: document-insert-new-file-header header
     Insert a new header file into this buffer.  Add reference to
     HEADER.  Used by `prototype' if this file doesn't have an
     introductory comment.

In addition to these base documentation commands, the texinfo semantic
parser includes a two convenience functions when working directly with
texinfo files.

 -- Command: semantic-texi-update-doc &optional tag
     Update the documentation for TAG.  If the current buffer is a
     texinfo file, then find the source doc, and update it.  If the
     current buffer is a source file, then get the documentation for
     this item, find the existing doc in the associated manual, and
     update that.

 -- Command: semantic-texi-goto-source &optional tag
     Jump to the source for the definition in the texinfo file TAG.  If
     TAG is `nil', it is derived from the deffn under POINT.

8 Charts
********

Some commands to draw charts of statistics generated from parsing:

 -- Command: semantic-chart-tags-by-class &optional tagtable
     Create a bar chart representing the number of tags for a given tag
     class.  Each bar represents how many toplevel tags in TAGTABLE
     exist with a given class.  See `semantic-symbol->name-assoc-list'
     for tokens which will be charted.  TAGTABLE is passedto
     "semantic-something-to-tag-table".

 -- Command: semantic-chart-database-size &optional tagtable
     Create a bar chart representing the size of each file in
     semanticdb.  Each bar represents how many toplevel tags in TAGTABLE
     exist in each database entry.  TAGTABLE is passed to
     "semantic-something-to-tag-table".

 -- Command: semantic-chart-tag-complexity &optional class tagtable
     Create a bar chart representing the complexity of some tags.
     Complexity is calculated for tags of CLASS.  Each bar represents
     the complexity of some tag in TAGTABLE.  Only the most complex
     items are charted.  TAGTABLE is passedto
     "semantic-something-to-tag-table".

9 Idle Scheduler
****************

The Idle Scheduler in Semantic 2.0 replaces what was once Auto-Parse
mode.  The Idle Scheduler now performs multiple duties.

The primary job is to schedule buffer parsing in idle time.  The first
buffer whose cache is checked is the current buffer.  After this, all
other buffers are checked.

Once that has been accomplished, scheduled idle processes that use the
semantic tag tables are run.

 -- Command: global-semantic-idle-scheduler-mode &optional arg
     Toggle global use of option "semantic-idle-scheduler-mode".  The
     idle scheduler with automatically reparse buffers in idle time,
     and then schedule other jobs setup with
     "semantic-idle-scheduler-add".  If ARG is positive, enable, if it
     is negative, disable.  If ARG is `nil', then toggle.

     *Compatibility*: `global-semantic-idle-scheduler-mode' introduced
     in semantic version 2.0 supercedes
     `global-semantic-auto-parse-mode' which is now obsolete.


*Compatibility*: `semantic-idle-scheduler-mode' introduced in semantic
version 2.0 supercedes `semantic-auto-parse-mode' which is now obsolete.

 -- Option: semantic-idle-scheduler-idle-time
     Time in seconds of idle before scheduling events.  This time
     should be short enough to ensure that idle-scheduler will be run
     as soon as Emacs is idle.

 -- Option: semantic-idle-scheduler-mode-hook
     Hook run at the end of function "semantic-idle-scheduler-mode".

 -- Option: semantic-idle-scheduler-verbose-flag
     Non-`nil' means that the idle scheduler should provide debug
     messages.  Use this setting to debug idle activities.

You can add new functionality to the idle scheduler by reading the
Application Developers Guide *note (semantic-appdev.info)Idle
Scheduling::.

File: semantic-user.info,  Node: Reparsing Options,  Next: Idle Working Options,  Up: Idle Scheduler

9.1 Reparsing Options
=====================

The Idle Scheduler will automatically reparse all buffers that need it.
User input at any time will cancel the operations and return to normal
editing.

9.1.1 Reparse Configuration
---------------------------

 -- Option: semantic-idle-scheduler-max-buffer-size
     Maximum size in bytes of buffers automatically reparsed.  If this
     value is less than or equal to 0, buffers are automatically
     reparsed regardless of their size.

9.1.2 Reparse Messages
----------------------

 -- Option: semantic-idle-scheduler-no-working-message
     If non-`nil', disable display of working messages during parse.

 -- Option: semantic-idle-scheduler-working-in-modeline-flag
     Non-`nil' means show working messages in the mode line.
     Typically, parsing will show messages in the minibuffer.  This
     will move the parse message into the modeline.

9.1.3 Reparsing Hooks
---------------------

 -- Variable: semantic-before-idle-scheduler-reparse-hooks
     Hooks run before option `semantic-idle-scheduler' begins parsing.
     If any hook throws an error, this variable is reset to nil.  This
     hook is not protected from lexical errors.

 -- Variable: semantic-after-idle-scheduler-reparse-hooks
     Hooks run after option `semantic-idle-scheduler' has parsed.  If
     any hook throws an error, this variable is reset to nil.  This
     hook is not protected from lexical errors.


File: semantic-user.info,  Node: Idle Working Options,  Next: Debugging Idle Time Issues,  Prev: Reparsing Options,  Up: Idle Scheduler

9.2 Idle Working Options
========================

Similiar to the reparsing that occurs at short intervals in idle time,
there is extra work that can be controlled to occur in idle time also.

Idle work occurs after a longer delay, and can be very time consuming.
The work done includes:

Create Include Path Caches
     Create the optimized search caches needed for symbol lookup.

Create Type Cache
     Create the datatype caches needed for intellisense features.

Save Databases
     All file-based semantic databases are saved to disk.

Parse neighboring files
     All files in the same directory as the current buffer are
     speculatively parsed.

These features can be controlled with the following variables:

 -- Option: semantic-idle-scheduler-work-idle-time
     Time in seconds of idle before scheduling big work.  This time
     should be long enough that once any big work is started, it is
     unlikely the user would be ready to type again right away.

 -- Option: semantic-idle-work-parse-neighboring-files-flag
     Non-`nil' means to parse files in the same dir as the current
     buffer.  Disable to prevent lots of excessive parsing in idle time.


File: semantic-user.info,  Node: Debugging Idle Time Issues,  Next: Idle Summary Mode,  Prev: Idle Working Options,  Up: Idle Scheduler

9.3 Debugging Idle Time Issues
==============================

If you see errors produced in idle time, it could be an indication of a
more serious issue elsewhere.  It is not enough to enable
`debug-on-error', as the idle timer tries to keep errors under wraps.

Instead, there are two commands you can use whenever you see an idle
error.

 -- Command: semantic-debug-idle-function
     Run the Semantic idle function with debugging turned on.

 -- Command: semantic-debug-idle-work-function
     Run the Semantic idle work function with debugging turned on.

Once you identify the general location of the idle error, you can send
the stack trace to the mailing list, or perhaps find a more focused way
to reproduce the issue.


File: semantic-user.info,  Node: Idle Summary Mode,  Next: Idle Completions Mode,  Prev: Debugging Idle Time Issues,  Up: Idle Scheduler

9.4 Idle Summary Mode
=====================

Similar to the Emacs Lisp facility eldoc, `semantic-idle-summary-mode'
will display the prototype, or other helpful doc about the symbol
currently under point.

 -- semantic-idle-summary-mode: &optional arg
     Display a tag summary of the lexical token under the cursor.  This
     means for getting the current tag to display information can be
     overriden with `idle-summary-current-symbol-info'.  This is a
     minor mode which performs actions during idle time.  With prefix
     argument ARG, turn on if positive, otherwise off.  The minor mode
     can be turned on only if semantic feature is available and the
     current buffer was set up for parsing.  Return non-nil if the
     minor mode is enabled


*Compatibility*: `semantic-idle-summary-mode' introduced in semantic
version 2.0 supercedes `semantic-summary-mode' which is now obsolete.

 -- Option: semantic-idle-summary-function
     Function to use when displaying tag information during idle time.
     Some useful functions are found in `semantic-format-tag-functions'.

 -- Variable: semantic-idle-summary-out-of-context-faces
     List of font-lock faces that indicate a useless summary context.
     Those are generally faces used to highlight comments or strings.

     It might be useful to override this variable to add comment faces
     specific to a major mode.  For example, in jde mode:

          (defvar-mode-local jde-mode semantic-idle-summary-out-of-context-faces
             (append (default-value 'semantic-idle-summary-out-of-context-faces)
          	   '(jde-java-font-lock-doc-tag-face
          	     jde-java-font-lock-link-face
          	     jde-java-font-lock-bold-face
          	     jde-java-font-lock-underline-face
          	     jde-java-font-lock-pre-face
          	     jde-java-font-lock-code-face)))



File: semantic-user.info,  Node: Idle Completions Mode,  Prev: Idle Summary Mode,  Up: Idle Scheduler

9.5 Idle Completions Mode
=========================

The definition of smart completion is described in the Analyzer section
*Note Analyzer::.

The Idle Completions mode will calculate the list of possible
completions in idle time, and display them in a popup list, or other
inline completion mechanism.

 -- semantic-idle-completions-mode: &optional arg
     Display a tooltip with a list of possible completions near the
     cursor.  There is no convenience for performing a completion
     replacement.  For that you should bind
     `semantic-ia-complete-symbol'.  This is a minor mode which
     performs actions during idle time.  With prefix argument ARG, turn
     on if positive, otherwise off.  The minor mode can be turned on
     only if semantic feature is available and the current buffer was
     set up for parsing.  Return non-nil if the minor mode is enabled

This mode operates by using the command
`semantic-complete-inline-analyzer'.

Idle completion uses the completion function
`semantic-complete-analyze-inline-idle'.  Changing the behavior of the
idle completion popups should be done through those utilities.

 -- Command: semantic-complete-analyze-inline-idle
     Perform prompt completion to do in buffer completion.
     "semantic-analyze-possible-completions" is used to determine the
     possible values.  The function returns immediately, leaving the
     buffer in a mode that will perform the completion.  Configure
     `semantic-complete-inline-analyzer-idle-displayor-class' to change
     how completion options are displayed.

 -- Option: semantic-complete-inline-analyzer-idle-displayor-class
     Class for displayor to use with inline completion at idle time.

     Customize this variable to get a list of options, such as popup
     tooltips, ghosting text, or traditional completion tools.

10 Minor Modes
**************

Semantic comes with a wide range of minor-modes which use various
features of semantic.  These modes vary widely in utility.

There are some core modes that are required for smooth operations.
Some of these are discussed in other chapters, such as *Note Idle
Scheduler::, and *Note semanticdb::

10.1 Code Helpers
=================

Code Helpers are minor modes that augment basic Emacs behavior in ways
that can assist in programming Semantic supported langauges.

File: semantic-user.info,  Node: Sticky Function Mode,  Next: Highlight Func Mode,  Up: Code Helpers

10.2.1 Sticky Function Headers
------------------------------

 -- Command: semantic-stickyfunc-mode &optional arg
     Minor mode to show the title of a tag in the header line.
     Enables/disables making the header line of functions sticky.  A
     function (or other tag class specified by
     `semantic-stickyfunc-sticky-classes') has a header line, meaning
     the first line which describes the rest of the construct.  This
     first line is what is displayed in the Emacs 21 header line.

     With prefix argument ARG, turn on if positive, otherwise off.  The
     minor mode can be turned on only if semantic feature is available
     and the current buffer was set up for parsing.  Return non-`nil'
     if the minor mode is enabled.

 -- Variable: semantic-stickyfunc-sticky-classes
     List of tag classes which sticky func will display in the header
     line.


File: semantic-user.info,  Node: Highlight Func Mode,  Next: Tag Decoration Mode,  Prev: Sticky Function Mode,  Up: Code Helpers

10.2.2 Highlight Func Mode
--------------------------

Highlight Func mode will put a highlight overlay over the top
declaration line of the function or tag the point is in.  Enabling this
feature also puts a context menu onto the declaration line providing
easy access to some basic commands.

 -- Function: semantic-highlight-func-mode &optional arg
     Minor mode to highlight the first line of the current tag.
     Enables/disables making the header line of functions sticky.  A
     function (or other tag class specified by
     `semantic-stickfunc-sticky-classes') is highlighted, meaning the
     first line which describes the rest of the construct.

     See `semantic-stickfunc-mode' for putting a function in the header
     line.  This mode recycles the stickyfunc configuration classes
     list.

     With prefix argument ARG, turn on if positive, otherwise off.  The
     minor mode can be turned on only if semantic feature is available
     and the current buffer was set up for parsing.  Return non-`nil'
     if the minor mode is enabled.

 -- Function: semantic-highlight-func-current-tag-face
     Face used to show the top of current function.


File: semantic-user.info,  Node: Tag Decoration Mode,  Next: MRU Bookmarks Mode,  Prev: Highlight Func Mode,  Up: Code Helpers

10.2.3 Tag Decoration Mode
--------------------------

Decoration mode is a harness that allows any parsed tag to be decorated
based on some arbitrary feature of that tag.  Decoration mode is
actually a full harness for providing any kind of decoration on a tag
based on a prefix function.

 -- Command: semantic-decoration-mode &optional arg
     Minor mode for decorating tags.  Decorations are specified in
     `semantic-decoration-styles'.  You can define new decoration
     styles with "define-semantic-decoration-style".  With prefix
     argument ARG, turn on if positive, otherwise off.  The minor mode
     can be turned on only if semantic feature is available and the
     current buffer was set up for parsing.  Return non-`nil' if the
     minor mode is enabled.

To enable or disable specific decorations, you can use this function:

 -- Command: semantic-toggle-decoration-style name &optional arg
     Turn on/off the decoration style with NAME.  Decorations are
     specified in `semantic-decoration-styles'.  With prefix argument
     ARG, turn on if positive, otherwise off.  Return non-`nil' if the
     decoration style is enabled.

10.2.3.1 Available decoration modes
...................................

There are several decoration modes that comes with semantic.

 -- Function: Command semantic-tag-boundary-mode &optional arg
     Place an overline in front of each long tag.

      -- Option: semantic-tag-boundary-face
          Face used to show long tags in.  Used by decoration style:
          `semantic-tag-boundary'.


 -- Function: Command semantic-decoration-on-private-members-mode
          &optional arg
     Highlight class members that are designated as PRIVATE access.

      -- Option: semantic-decoration-on-private-members-face
          Face used to show privately scoped tags in.  Used by the
          decoration style: `semantic-decoration-on-private-members'.

 -- Function: Command semantic-decoration-on-protected-members-mode
          &optional arg
     Highlight class members that are designated as PROTECTED access.

      -- Option: semantic-decoration-on-protected-members-face
          Face used to show protected scoped tags in.  Used by the
          decoration style: `semantic-decoration-on-protected-members'.

 -- Command: semantic-decoration-on-includes &optional arg
     Highlight class members that are includes.  This mode provides a
     nice context menu on the include statements.  Use the menus to ask
     questions and get help on configuring semantic.

      -- Option: semantic-decoration-on-includes
          Overlay Face used on includes that are not in some other
          state.  Used by the decoration style:
          `semantic-decoration-on-includes'.

      -- Option: semantic-decoration-on-unknown-includes
          Face used to show includes that cannot be found.  Used by the
          decoration style: `semantic-decoration-on-unknown-includes'.

      -- Option: semantic-decoration-on-unparsed-includes
          Face used to show includes that have not yet been parsed.
          Used by the decoration style:
          `semantic-decoration-on-unparsed-includes'.


10.2.3.2 Create New Decoration Modes
....................................

You can create new types of decorations using the following function:

 -- Function: define-semantic-decoration-style name doc &rest flags
     Define a new decoration style with NAME.  DOC is a documentation
     string describing the decoration style NAME.  It is appended to
     auto-generated doc strings.  An Optional list of FLAGS can also be
     specified.  Flags are:   `:enabled' <value>  - specify the default
     enabled value for NAME.

     This defines two new overload functions respectively called
     `NAME-p' and `NAME-highlight', for which you must provide a default
     implementation in respectively the functions `NAME-p-default' and
     `NAME-highlight-default'.  Those functions are passed a tag.
     `NAME-p' must return non-`nil' to indicate that the tag should be
     decorated by `NAME-highlight'.

     To put primary decorations on a tag `NAME-highlight' must use
     functions like "semantic-set-tag-face",
     "semantic-set-tag-intangible", etc., found in the
     semantic-decorate library.

     To add other kind of decorations on a tag, `NAME-highlight' must
     use "semantic-decorate-tag", and other functions of the semantic
     decoration API found in this library.


File: semantic-user.info,  Node: MRU Bookmarks Mode,  Prev: Tag Decoration Mode,  Up: Code Helpers

10.2.4 MRU Bookmarks Mode
-------------------------

MRU stands for Most Recently Used.  Semantic MRU Bookmarks track the
tags you edit and maintain a ring of things you've been working on.
You can then switch back to tags you've worked on recently by name.

 -- Command: semantic-mru-bookmark-mode &optional arg
     Minor mode for tracking tag-based bookmarks automatically.  Tag
     based bookmarks a tracked based on editing and viewing habits and
     can then be navigated via the MRU bookmark keymap.

     With prefix argument ARG, turn on if positive, otherwise off.  The
     minor mode can be turned on only if semantic feature is available
     and the current buffer was set up for parsing.  Return non-`nil'
     if the minor mode is enabled.

Once this mode is enabled, any edit, or mark setting will add the
current tag to your MRU bookmark ring.

`C-x B'
     This keysequence is like `switch-to-buffer', but uses a capital
     `B' instead of lower case.  This lets you type in a tag name, or
     use `M-p' and `M-n' to cycle through the bookmark list in MRU
     order.

10.2.5 Highlight Edits Mode
---------------------------

Highlight edits mode is useful mostly for debugging the incremental
parser.  As you change text, that effected text is highlighted, and you
can visual predict what actions the incremental parser will need to
make.

 -- Command: semantic-highlight-edits-mode &optional arg
     Minor mode for highlighting changes made in a buffer.  Changes are
     tracked by semantic so that the incremental parser can work
     properly.  With prefix argument ARG, turn on if positive,
     otherwise off.  The minor mode can be turned on only if semantic
     feature is available and the current buffer was set up for
     parsing.  Return non-`nil' if the minor mode is enabled.

 -- Face: semantic-highlight-edits-face
     Face used to show dirty tokens in `semantic-highlight-edits-mode'.

10.2.6 Parser State
-------------------

 -- Command: semantic-show-parser-state-mode &optional arg
     Minor mode for displaying parser cache state in the modeline.  The
     cache can be in one of three states.  They are Up to date, Partial
     reparse needed, and Full reparse needed.  The state is indicated
     in the modeline with the following characters:
    `-'
          The cache is up to date.

    `!'
          The cache requires a full update.

    `~'
          The cache needs to be incrementally parsed.

    `%'
          The buffer is not lexically parseable.

     With prefix argument ARG, turn on if positive, otherwise off.  The
     minor mode can be turned on only if semantic feature is available
     and the current buffer was set up for parsing.  Return non-`nil'

10.2.7 Unmatched Syntax Highlighting
------------------------------------

 -- Command: semantic-show-unmatched-syntax-mode &optional arg
     Minor mode to highlight unmatched syntax tokens.  When a parser
     executes, some elements in the buffer may not match any parser
     rules.  These text characters are considered unmatched syntax.
     Often time, the display of unmatched syntax can expose coding
     problems before the compiler is run.

     With prefix argument ARG, turn on if positive, otherwise off.  The
     minor mode can be turned on only if semantic feature is available
     and the current buffer was set up for parsing.  Return non-`nil'
     if the minor mode is enabled.

     `C-c , `'		"semantic-show-unmatched-syntax-next"

 -- Option: semantic-unmatched-syntax-face
     Face used to show unmatched-syntax in.  The face is used in
     "semantic-show-unmatched-syntax-mode".

11 Semantic Database
********************

Semanticdb is a utility which tracks your parsed files, and saves the
parsed information to disk.  When you reload your source files,
semanticdb automatically associates the file with the cached copy,
saving time by not re-parsing your buffer.

Semanticdb also provides an API for programs to use to look up
information about a tag.  These functions can return tag information
without loading the source file into memory.

Lastly, the semanticdb interface allows programmers to create alternate
back ends.  Such a back end could allow access to tag information in
binary files, not normally accessable to semantic.  A back end could
also be written to store tag information in an alternate form of
persistent storage.

To use semanticdb, add the following to your `.emacs' file:

     (require 'semanticdb)
     (global-semanticdb-minor-mode 1)

If you use `semantic-load.el', or the default CEDET install mechanism,
you do not need to add the above lines in your `.emacs' file.

The Semantic Database has several user level configuration options that
controls it's use.  From the user perspective, it appears to be one
large application.  Internally it is divided into sections.

Core Tables
     These core tables for semanticdb are not associated with files, or
     backends.  They define the basic behavior of a database and table.

Persistent Tables
     These databases are what are generally used in semantic to store
     information to disk.

Custom Backends
     These databases and tables are interfaces to some other source of
     tagging information, such as the symbols loaded in Emacs Lisp, or
     perhaps symbols in a Java `.class' file.

You can execute hooks when semanticdb is activated using its mode hook.

 -- Option: semanticdb-mode-hooks
     Hooks run whenever "global-semanticdb-minor-mode" is run.  Use
     "semanticdb-minor-mode-p" to determine if the mode has been turned
     on or off.

11.1 Semanticdb Tag Storage
===========================

Once you have tables of tags parsed from your files, the default action
is to save them when Emacs exits.  You can control the file name and
directories where the caches are stored.

 -- Option: semanticdb-default-file-name
     File name of the semantic tag cache.

 -- Option: semanticdb-default-save-directory
     Directory name where semantic cache files are stored.  If this
     value is `nil', files are saved in the current directory.  If the
     value is a valid directory, then it overrides
     `semanticdb-default-file-name' and stores caches in a coded file
     name in this directory.

 -- Option: semanticdb-persistent-path
     List of valid paths that semanticdb will cache tags to.  When
     "global-semanticdb-minor-mode" is active, tag lists will be saved
     to disk when Emacs exits.  Not all directories will have tags that
     should be saved.  The value should be a list of valid paths.  A
     path can be a string, indicating a directory in which to save a
     variable.  An element in the list can also be a symbol.  Valid
     symbols are `never', which will disable any saving anywhere,
     `always', which enables saving everywhere, or `project', which
     enables saving in any directory that passes a list of predicates
     in `semanticdb-project-predicate-functions'.

 -- Variable: semanticdb-project-predicate-functions
     List of predicates to try that indicate a directory belongs to a
     project.  This list is used when `semanticdb-persistent-path'
     contains the value `'project'.  If the predicate list is `nil',
     then presume all paths are valid.

     Project Management software (such as EDE and JDE) should add their
     own predicates with "add-hook" to this variable, and semanticdb
     will save tag caches in directories controlled by them.

 -- Option: semanticdb-save-database-hooks
     Hooks run after a database is saved.  Each function is called with
     one argument, the object representing the database recently
     written.

11.2 Semanticdb Search Configuration
====================================

When different tools such as smart completion or tag jumping needs to
find a tag, those routines call semanticdb search routines.  Getting
the search path configured usually takes a little bit of time to get
right.

The search path includes:

  1. The current file

  2. a table for each #include file

  3. if 'recursive is in the throttle, then all include files included
     in include files.

Include files or equivalent are found in:

  1. current directory

  2. directories specified by your project.  (such as EDE, or the
     `semanticdb-project-roots' variable.)

  3. system directories

In C/C++ code, semantic tries to distinguish between project and system
headers based on `""' or `<>' delimiters.  Each language can
distinguish using it's own rules.

The system directory is set up via the variable
`semantic-dependency-system-include-path'.  The path is also modified
by some system database create routines, such as
`semanticdb-create-ebrowse-database'. *Note Include paths::.

You can use the command:

     M-x semantic-add-system-include RET /some/path

to add more paths interactively into the current mode's path.  This
will allow semantic to find more files w/out using system databases.
To customize the system include path for a particular major mode, use
the command:

     M-x semantic-customize-system-include-path RET

File: semantic-user.info,  Node: Semanticdb Roots,  Next: Include paths,  Up: Semanticdb Search Configuration

11.2.1 SemanticDB project roots
-------------------------------

Project roots specify where different code projects start.  Searching
for files usually stops within a single project, so specifying these
roots is important if you want semantic to find tags in other related
directories.

 -- Option: semanticdb-project-roots
     List of directories, where each directory is the root of some
     project.  All subdirectories of a root project are considered a
     part of one project.  Values in this string can be overriden by
     project management programs via the
     `semanticdb-project-root-functions' variable.

 -- Variable: semanticdb-project-root-functions
     List of functions used to determine a given directories project
     root.  Functions in this variable can override
     `semanticdb-project-roots'.  Functions set in the variable are
     given one argument (a directory) and must return a string, (the
     root directory) or a list of strings (multiple root directories in
     a more complex system).  This variable should be used by project
     management programs like EDE or JDE.

Alternately, you can use EDE for project management, and EDE will then
handle search routines as above.  See the *note EDE Manual: (ede)top
for more.

11.2.2 Include Paths
--------------------

You can add and remove system include paths based on major mode using
the following commands:

 -- Command: semantic-add-system-include dir &optional mode
     Add a system include DIR to path for MODE.  Modifies a mode-local
     version of `semantic-dependency-system-include-path'.

 -- Command: semantic-remove-system-include dir &optional mode
     Add a system include DIR to path for MODE.  Modifies a mode-local
     version of `semantic-dependency-system-include-path'.

 -- Command: semantic-customize-system-include-path &optional mode
     Customize the include path for this `major-mode'.  To create a
     customizable include path for a major MODE, use the macro
     "defcustom-mode-local-semantic-dependency-system-include-path".

For a bit more on include paths, see the *note Search Optimization
section: (semantic)Search Optimization.

File: semantic-user.info,  Node: Search Throttle,  Next: Semanticdb search debugging commands,  Prev: Include paths,  Up: Semanticdb Search Configuration

11.2.3 SemanticDB Search Throttle
---------------------------------

The semanticdb find throttle is a configuration variable that may often
be configured by a language support author.  If you need to customize
this for yourself, you may need to override the mode values in a mode
support hook.

 -- Variable: semanticdb-find-default-throttle
     The default throttle for `semanticdb-find' routines.  The throttle
     controls how detailed the list of database tables is for a symbol
     lookup.  The value is a list with the following keys:

    `file'
          The file the search is being performed from.  This option is
          here for completeness only, and is assumed to always be on.

    `local'
          Tables from the same local directory are included.  This
          includes files directly referenced by a file name which might
          be in a different directory.

    `project'
          Tables from the same local project are included If `project'
          is specified, then `local' is assumed.

    `unloaded'
          If a table is not in memory, load it.  If it is not cached on
          disk either, get the source, parse it, and create the table.

    `system'
          Tables from system databases.  These are specifically tables
          from system header files, or language equivalent.

    `recursive'
          For include based searches, includes tables referenced by
          included files.

    `omniscience'
          Included system databases which are omniscience, or somehow
          know everything.  Omniscience databases are found in
          `semanticdb-project-system-databases'.  The Emacs Lisp system
          DB is an omniscience database.


To set the throttle, use a command like this:

     (setq-mode-local c-mode
     		 semanticdb-find-default-throttle
     		 '(project unloaded system recursive))

The default value of the throttle is for maximum accuracy at the
expense of time taken to perform a particular look-up.  The throttle is
tweaked by `semantic-idle-summary-mode' to remove 'unloaded, thus
removing poor speed at unexpected times.


File: semantic-user.info,  Node: Semanticdb search debugging commands,  Prev: Search Throttle,  Up: Semanticdb Search Configuration

11.2.4 Semanticdb search debugging commands
-------------------------------------------

You can use `M-x semanticdb-dump-all-table-summary RET' to see the list
of databases that will be searched from a given buffer.  It should
include DBs for the directories you expect.  You can follow up with
`M-x semanticdb-find-test-translate-path RET' to then make sure
specific tables from the path are discovered correctly.

Alternately, you can get a list of include files semantic encountered,
but could not find on disk using `M-x
semanticdb-find-adebug-lost-includes RET'.

Once you have used the below functions to debug the problem, you may
need to reconfigure how semantic finds include files.  See *Note
Semanticdb Search Configuration::.  If the search config is ok, you may
need to configure the search throttle. See *Note Search Throttle::.

 -- Command: semanticdb-dump-all-table-summary
     Dump a list of all databases in Emacs memory.

 -- Command: semanticdb-find-test-translate-path &optional arg
     Call and output results of "semanticdb-find-translate-path" With
     ARG non-`nil', specify a BRUTISH translation.

 -- Command: semanticdb-find-adebug-lost-includes
     Translate the current path, then display the lost includes.
     Examines the variable `semanticdb-find-lost-includes'.

Lastly, you can test an explicit search term using this command:

 -- Command: semantic-adebug-searchdb regex
     Search the semanticdb for REGEX for the current buffer.  Display
     the results as a debug list.


File: semantic-user.info,  Node: Semanticdb System Backends,  Next: Changing Backends,  Prev: Semanticdb Search Configuration,  Up: semanticdb

11.3 Semanticdb System Backends
===============================

These variables should be set up automatically when you choose to use
different system databases.

 -- Variable: semanticdb-project-system-databases
     List of databases containing system library information.  Mode
     authors can create their own system databases which know detailed
     information about the system libraries for querying purposes.  Put
     those into this variable as a buffer-local, or mode-local value.

These system databases are a part of the `omniscience' throttle value.

While these are enabled with `semanticdb-find-default-throttle', a
secondary flag is needed for internal controls that prevent recursive
duplication.

 -- Variable: semanticdb-search-system-databases
     Non `nil' if search routines are to include a system database.


File: semantic-user.info,  Node: Changing Backends,  Next: Script Generated Cache Files,  Prev: Semanticdb System Backends,  Up: semanticdb

11.4 Changing Backends
======================

If you want to use some other form of backend, you can use this
variable to choose which back end class to use for your general tag
storage.

The default is to save databases in flat files.  Alternatively, you
could write a new database backend that stores tags into a database, or
other storage system.

 -- Variable: semanticdb-new-database-class
     The default type of database created for new files.  This can be
     changed on a per file basis, so that some directories are saved
     using one mechanism, and some directories via a different
     mechanism.


File: semantic-user.info,  Node: Script Generated Cache Files,  Next: Create System Databases,  Prev: Changing Backends,  Up: semanticdb

11.5 Script Generated Cache Files
=================================

You can create new semantic databases with the `semanticdb.sh' script
file.  Give this script the directory you want parsed, and it will
create a cache file for you.

     $ semanticdb.sh *.el

To use these generated tables, you would likely need to restart Emacs.


File: semantic-user.info,  Node: Create System Databases,  Prev: Script Generated Cache Files,  Up: semanticdb

11.6 Create System Databases
============================

If your supported language stores the system libraries in readily
available parsable source code, you can pre-generate database files for
them once, which will be used over and over for tools such as
summary-mode, or the analyzer.

 -- Command: semanticdb-create-ebrowse-database dir
     Create an EBROWSE database for directory DIR.  The database file
     is stored in ~/.semanticdb, or whichever directory is specified by
     `semanticdb-default-system-save-directory'.

12 Debugging speed and accuracy issues
**************************************

If aspects of semantic cause your Emacs to slow down or block editing,
there are several things that may be happening.  The most time
consuming aspect of semantic is usually the parsing of files for tag
information, and this action can be triggered from many possible
sources.

A simple way to determine where the problem lies is to use the command
`M-x debug-on-quit RET' and then just hit `C-g' next time it gets
'stuck' somewhere.  It will give you a stack and one of the many
semantic mode functions will likely show up in that stack trace.

From a simple standpoint, your next action might be to use the the
Senator menu under `Modes' and just toggle suspected modes on and off.

12.1 Idle function errors
=========================

If the idle scheduler starts reporting errors, then you can run the
command `M-x semantic-debug-idle-function RET' to get a stacktrace to
report.

If this doesn't report an issue, then you may have found a bug in the
idle work function, where longer tasks are scheduled.  To debug that,
use the command `M-x semantic-debug-idle-work-function RET'.

12.2 Analyzer debugging
=======================

When the semantic analyzer provides bad or non-existent completions,
then you will need to debug the analyzer.  Place the cursor where the
problem is, and then use the command `M-x semantic-analyze-debug-assist
RET'.

This will perform an analysis, and then offer suggestions on what might
be wrong, and how to reconfigure semantic to solve the problem.

12.3 Symbol lookup
==================

There are many minor modes that have special behaviors tied into the
current parser state, with the most complex modes being the summary and
completion modes.  These modes can initiate parsing not only in the
current buffer, but in other buffers that are referred to in the
current source by some form of include statement.

If they turn out not to be useful in the language mode you are
operating in, then it may be best to disable them.

Alternately, you can control how these major modes, and other modes
like them parse alternate files by adjusting
`semanticdb-find-default-throttle'. You can read more in *note
(semantic-appdev.info)DB Search Paths::.

12.4 Interruptibility
=====================

One of the goals with the semantic based minor modes and auto parse is
that it should be interruptible.  Thus, a keyboard action should
interrupt any active parsing or mode activity.  In practice, I've found
this doesn't always work and I've been a bit stymied as to why.

You can test the interruptibility framework by running `M-x
semantic-test-throw-on-input RET' and seeing that you can press any key
to break out of the loop.

12.5 Incremental parsing
========================

The incremental parser used by semantic will reparse only small
sections of a file you have edited, which eliminates the need to
reparse entire files.  This speeds up minor modes that need the local
buffer to be up to date, such as speedbar or ECB.

If the incremental parsing is not always working for you (meaning it
will parse the whole file frequently while you edit) then perhaps you
need to customize `semantic-edits-verbose-flag' to enable some friendly
debug output.  Additionally using
`semantic-load-enable-semantic-debugging-helpers' to help identify
possible problem areas by enabling highlight edits mode and show parser
state mode *note (semantic-langdev.info)Incremental Parser Debugging::

12.6 Profiling
==============

To help identify speed issues with the semantic analyzer, you can use
the `semantic-elp.el' tool.  To use it type:

     M-x semantic-elp-analyze RET

It will do a full run for each stage of analysis keeping profiling
information.  The analysis will be done at point, so be sure to
position the cursor at the location where the slowdown occurs.

Once done, it will ask you to save the profiler information.  It will
then show you the profile information in ADEBUG mode, so you can
navigate through the results.

Use `SPC' to open sections of the tree.  Use `SPC' on the sort option
to change sorting of the results table.

Use `M-x semantic-elp-load-old-run' to restore an old run and view it
again.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
     the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
     modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
     this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
     credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
     modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.


  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
     under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to
     any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee,
     and is addressed as "you".

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
     section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
     relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
     Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
     nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
     (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
     mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
     The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
     the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
     philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly
     and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed
     to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
     Transparent.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
     Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
     or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than
     100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you
     must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,
     all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
     computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
     of the Document, free of added material, which the general
     network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
     charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

     A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
     distinct    from that of the Document, and from those of previous
     versions    (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
     History section    of the Document).  You may use the same title
     as a previous version    if the original publisher of that version
     gives permission.
     B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
     entities    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
     Modified    Version, together with at least five of the principal
     authors of the    Document (all of its principal authors, if it
     has less than five).
     C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
     Modified Version, as the publisher.
     D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
     E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
     adjacent to the other copyright notices.
     F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
     notice    giving the public permission to use the Modified Version
     under the    terms of this License, in the form shown in the
     Addendum below.
     G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
     Sections    and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
     license notice.
     H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
     I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add
     to    it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
       publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.
     If    there is no section entitled "History" in the Document,
     create one    stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of
     the Document as    given on its Title Page, then add an item
     describing the Modified    Version as stated in the previous
     sentence.
     J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
     likewise    the network locations given in the Document for
     previous versions    it was based on.  These may be placed in the
     "History" section.     You may omit a network location for a work
     that was published at    least four years before the Document
     itself, or if the original    publisher of the version it refers
     to gives permission.
     K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
     preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
      substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
     and/or dedications given therein.
     L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
     unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
     or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
     M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
     may not be included in the Modified Version.
     N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"    or to
     conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties-for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition
     of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
     Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
     copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
     called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
     other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
     account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
     derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
     quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
     placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
     aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
     aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License provided that you also include the
     original English version of this License.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original English
     version of this License, the original English version will prevail.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:


       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
       Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant
Sections" instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover
Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
