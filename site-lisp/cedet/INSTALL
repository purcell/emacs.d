CEDET: Collection of Emacs Development Enviromnent Tools

CEDET is a top-level project containing several individual package for Emacs,
includeing:

   EIEIO -    CLOS layer for Emacs Lisp
   Semantic - Parser Infrastructure for Emacs
   Speedbar - Everything browser
   EDE -      File manager/ Makefile generator
   SRecode -  Templte manager/ code generator
   COGRE -    Connected Graph Editor

REQUIREMENTS:

   The full CEDET suite requires Emacs 22.1 or newer.
   CEDET works well with either Emacs 21.3 or XEmacs 21.3.
   Older versions of either will also work with fewer CEDET
   features being available.

   If you use a binary install of Emacs, you may need the .el
   files for Emacs available for some aspects of the build.

   CEDET is always developed on a recent CVS build of Emacs, and often
   takes advantage of such new features.

INSTALL:

You can install all these packagees at once with the CEDET build and
install scripts:

1) Copy source files somewhere.

2) Byte compile

   There are several ways to get CEDET compiled:

   a) make

   b) make EMACS=<your favorite emacs>

    You might also have trouble with makeinfo.  If you need to upgrade
    makeinfo, you can do this:

  c) make MAKEINFO=/usr/local/bin/makeinfo

    Note: For speedbar, and older versions of Emacs, you may also need
          to byte-compile the version of INFO and RMAIL that come with
          your version of emacs.

  d) make MAKEINFO=echo

    To skip making the doc.


  e) cedet-build.el

    If you do not have "make", are on Windows, or otherwise cannot use
    the Makefiles, you can build CEDET from within Emacs.  See the
    commentary in cedet-build.el


2.1) Build Issues

  If running MAKE fails due to other issues such as bad loaddef
  files, custom-autoload, incomprehensible run time errors during a byte
  compilation, try these steps, then go back to step 2.

  a) make clean-autoloads
  b) make clean-all

2.2) Make Issues

  If the version of Make you are using doesn't work with the CEDET
  Makefiles, (such as the version on AIX) you will need to download and
  install GNU Make to use with these Makefiles.  Alternately, 
  see cedet-build.el

3) Install load hooks into your .emacs file.  For more detail on
   any topic, see the info file common/cedet.info for more details on
   installaiton.

-----------
;; Load CEDET.
;; See cedet/common/cedet.info for configuration details.
(load-file "~/cedet-VERSION/common/cedet.el")


;; Enable EDE (Project Management) features
(global-ede-mode 1)

;; Enable EDE for a pre-existing C++ project
;; (ede-cpp-root-project "NAME" :file "~/myproject/Makefile")


;; Enabling Semantic (code-parsing, smart completion) features
;; Select one of the following:

;; * This enables the database and idle reparse engines
(semantic-load-enable-minimum-features)

;; * This enables some tools useful for coding, such as summary mode
;;   imenu support, and the semantic navigator
(semantic-load-enable-code-helpers)

;; * This enables even more coding tools such as intellisense mode
;;   decoration mode, and stickyfunc mode (plus regular code helpers)
;; (semantic-load-enable-gaudy-code-helpers)

;; * This enables the use of Exuberent ctags if you have it installed.
;;   If you use C++ templates or boost, you should NOT enable it.
;; (semantic-load-enable-all-exuberent-ctags-support)

;; Enable SRecode (Template management) minor-mode.
;; (global-srecode-minor-mode 1)

-----------

  Some items in the contrib directory may need additional study or
  installation.  Read contrib/INSTALL for specifics on those extra
  packages.

3.1) CODE COMPLETION

  If you are installing CEDET to get code completion, see the info
  manual in common/cedet.info for more specifically about code
  completion.

3.2) INSTALL INFO

   Installing the info files can be done with:

     make install-info

   or, if you need to specify:

     make PREFIX=/prefix/to/install/to install-info

4) CONFIGURE:

   You can configure how the individual packages loaded in the above
   example by adding settings in the comment section.  Please read
   individual info manuals for each package for details on configuring
   them.  See the texinfo manuals for details on more specific
   configurations.

   To dive right into configuring CEDET for a particular purpose, many
   common purposes are enumerated in the CEDET installation info file.
