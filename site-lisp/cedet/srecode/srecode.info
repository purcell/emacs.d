SRecoder Manual
***************

SRecode is the Semantic Recoder.  Where semantic will parse source
files into lists of tags, the Semantic Recoder will aid in converting
semantic tags and various other information back into various types of
code.

   While the SRecode tool provides a template language, templates for
several languages, and even a sequence of heuristics that aid the user
in choosing a template to insert, this is not the main goal of SRecode.

   The goal of SRecode is to provide an application framework where
someone can write a complex code generator, and the underlying template
commonality allows it to work in multiple languages with ease.

1 Quick Start
*************

When you install CEDET and enable SRecode, an `SRecoder' menu item
should appear.

   To toggle SRecode minor mode on and off use:

     M-x srecode-minor-mode RET
   or
     M-x global-srecode-minor-mode RET

   or add

     (srecode-minor-mode 1)

   into a language hook function to force it on (which is the default)
or pass in `-1' to force it off.

   See *Note SRecode Minor Mode:: for more on using the minor mode.

   Use the menu to insert templates into the current file.

   You can add your own templates in `~/.srecode', or update the
template map path:

 -- Option: srecode-map-load-path
     Global load path for SRecode template files.

   Once installed, you can start inserting templates using the menu, or
the command:

 -- Command: srecode-insert template-name &rest dict-entries
     Insert the template TEMPLATE-NAME into the current buffer at point.
     DICT-ENTRIES are additional dictionary values to add.

   SRecode Insert will prompt for a template name.  Template names are
specific to each major mode.  A typical name is of the form:
`CONTEXT:NAME' where a CONTEXT might be something like `file' or
`declaration'.  The same NAME can occur in multiple contexts.


File: srecode.info,  Node: User Templates,  Next: Parts of SRecode,  Prev: Quick Start,  Up: Top

2 User Templates
****************

SRecode builds and maintains a map of all template files.  The root
template files resides in the SRecode distribution.  User written
templates files are saved in `~/.srecode', along with the SRecode map
file.

 -- Variable: srecode-map-save-file
     The save location for SRecode's map file.

   Template files end with a `.srt' extension.  Details on how to write
templates are in *Note Template Writing::.

   Each template file you write is dedicated to a single major mode.  In
it, you can write templates within the same context and with the same
name as core templates.  You can force your templates to override the
core templates for a particular major mode by setting the priority.
See *Note Special Variables::.

   To get going quickly, open a new `.srt' file.  It will start in the
SRecode template writing mode.  Use the SRecode minor mode menu to
insert the `empty' file template.

   When using templates in other modes (such as C++ or Emacs Lisp
templates), use the "Edit Template" menu to find a template you would
like to update.  Copy it into your user template file, and change it.

   If you were to update `declaration:function' in your user template
file, then you would get this new template instead of the one that
comes with SRecode.  Higher level applications should always use
`declaration:function' when generating their own code, so higher level
templates will then adopt your changes to `declaration:function' into
themselves.

   You can also override variables.  Core variables are stored in the
SRecode root template file `default.srt', and that contains the
copyright usually used, and some basic file setup formats.  Override
variables like this by specifying a `mode' of `default' like this:

     set mode "default"

3 Parts of SRecode
******************

The SRecode system is made up of several layers which work together to
generate code.

3.1 Template Layer
==================

The template layer provides a way to write, and compile templates.  The
template layer is the scheme used to insert text into an Emacs buffer.

   The SRecode template layer is more advanced than other modes like the
Emacs packages `skeleton' or `tempo' in that it allows multiple layers
of templates to be created with the same names.  This means that
SRecode can provide a wide range of templates, and users can override
only the small sections they want, instead of either accepting someone
else's template, or writing large new templates of their own.

   Templates are written in `.srt' files.  You can learn how to author
new `.srt' files *Note Template Writing::.

   While the template system was designed for SRecode based
applications it can also be used independently for simple template
insertion during typical coding.

3.2 Template Manager
====================

Once templates have been written, a scheme for loading and selecting
templates is needed.  The template manager has a loader for finding
template files, and determining which templates are relevant to the
current buffer.  Template files are sorted by priority, with user
templates being found first, and system level default templates last.
Templates are also sorted by application.  Each application has it's
own templates, and are kept seperate from the generic templates.

3.3 Dictionary
==============

Dictionaries contain values associated with macro names.  A value can
be one of three things; a string, a list of more dictionaries, or a
special `srecode-dictionary-compound-value' object subclass.

3.4 Template Insertion
======================

The template insertion layer involves extensions to the basic template
layer.  A wide range of custom macros are available for mixing derived
data as macros into the plain text of a template.

   In addition, templates can be declared with arguments.  These
arguments represent predetermined sets of dictionary values, such as
features of the current file name, user name, time, etc.

   Some arguments are major-mode specific, such as the `:el' or `:cpp'
arguments.

3.5 Template Insertion Context
==============================

A context can be provided for templates in a file.  This helps
auto-selection of templates by name, or allows templates in different
contexts to have the same name.  Some standard contexts are `file',
`declaration', and `classdecl'.

   A context can be automatically derived as well based on the parsing
state from Semantic.  *note Semantic Manual: (semantic)Top.

3.6 Applications
================

Commands that do a particular user task which involves also writing
Emacs Lisp code.  Applications are at the top layer.  These
applications have their own template files and logic needed to fill in
dictionaries or position a cursor.

3.7 Field Editing
=================

If the variable `srecode-insert-with-fields-p' is set, then variables
that would normally ask a question, will instead create "fields" in the
buffer.  A field-editing layer provides simple interaction through the
fields.


File: srecode.info,  Node: SRecode Minor Mode,  Next: Template Writing,  Prev: Parts of SRecode,  Up: Top

4 SRecode Minor Mode
********************

The Semantic Recode minor mode enables a keymap and menu that provides
simple access to different templates or template applications.

   The key prefix is <C-c />.

   If the variable `srecode-takeover-INS-key' is set, the the key
<<insert>> can also be used.

   The most important key is bound to `srecode-insert' which is <C-c /
/>, or <insert insert>.  *Note Quick Start::.

   Major keybindings are:

<C-c / <lower case letter>>
     Reserved for direct binding of simple templates to keys using a
     keybinding command in the template file.

<C-c / <upper case letter>>
     Reserved for template applications (Such as comment or get/set
     inserter.)

<C-c / E>
     Edit the code of a template.

<C-c / .>
     Insert template again.  This will cause the previously inserted
     template to be inserted again.

4.1 Field Editing
=================

By default, when inserting a template, if the user needs to enter text
to fill in a part of the template, then the minibuffer is used to query
for that information.  SRecode also supports a field-edting mode that
can be used instead.  To enable it set:

 -- Variable: srecode-insert-with-fields-p
     Non-`nil' means to insert editable fields with the template.  When
     this is `nil', then questions are asked in the mini-buffer.  When
     fields are used, areas are shown with overlays that can be TABbed
     between for quick inline-editing.

   Field editing mode is supported in newever versions of Emacs.  You
will not be prompted to fill in values while the template is inserted.
Instead, short regions will be highlighted, and the cursor placed in a
field.  Typing in the field will then fill in the value.  Several
fields might be linked together.  In that case, typing in one area will
modify the other linked areas.  Pressing TAB will move between editable
fields in the template.

   Once the cursor moves out of the are inserted by the template, all
the fields are cancelled.

   Of note: Some conveniences in templates, such as completion, or
character restrictins are lost when using field editing mode.

templates.  SRecode files (Extension `.srt') are made up of variable
settings and template declarations.

5.1 Variables
=============

Variables can be set up and used in templates.  Many variables you may
use are set up via template arguments, but some may be preferences a
user can set up that are used in system templates.

   When expanding a template, variables are stored in a "dictionary".
Dictionary entries are variables.  Variables defined in templates can
have string like values.

   A variable can be set like this:
     set VARNAME "some value"

* Menu:

* String Values::       Basic Variable values
* Multi-string Values:: Complex variable values
* Section Show::        Enabling the display of a named section.

* Automatic Loop Variables:: Variables automatically set in section loops.
* Compound Variable Values:: Compound Variable Values


File: srecode.info,  Node: String Values,  Next: Multi-string Values,  Up: Variables

5.1.1 String Values
-------------------

Variables can be set to strings.  Strings may contain newlines or any
other characters.  Strings are interpreted by the Emacs Lisp reader so
`\n', `\t', and `\"' work.

   When a string is inserted as part of a template, nothing within the
string is interperted, such as template escape characters.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Multi-string Values,  Next: Section Show,  Prev: String Values,  Up: Variables

5.1.2 Multi-string Values
-------------------------

A variable can be set to multiple strings.  A compound value is usually
used when you want to use dictionary entries as part of a variable
later on.

   Multi-string variable values are set like string values except there
are more than one.  For example

     set NAME "this" "-mode"

   These two strings will be concatenated together.

   A more useful thing is to include dictionary macros and concatenate
those into the string.  For example:

     set NAME macro "MODE" "-mode"

   will extract the value of the dictionary macro MODE and append
"-mode" to the end.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Section Show,  Next: Special Variables,  Prev: Multi-string Values,  Up: Variables

5.1.3 Section Show
------------------

To set a variable to show a template section, use the `show' command.
Sections are blocks of a template wrapped in section macros.  If there
is a section macro NAME it will be shown for each dictionary associated
with the NAME macro.

     show NAME

   This will enable that section.

   NOTE: May 11, 2008 - I haven't used this yet, so I don't know if it
works.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Special Variables,  Next: Automatic Loop Variables,  Prev: Section Show,  Up: Variables

5.1.4 Special Variables
-----------------------

Some variables have special meaning that changes attributes when
templates are compiled, including:

`escape-start'
     This is the character sequence that escapes from raw text to
     template macro names.

`escape-end'
     This is the character sequence that escapes the end of a template
     macro name.

`mode'
     This is the major mode, as a string with the Emacs Lisp symbol in
     it.  All templates in this file will be installed into the
     template table for this major mode.

     Multiple template files can use the same mode, and all those
     templates will be mixed together.

`priority'
     The priority of a file indicates where it lies in the template
     search order.  System templates default to large priority numbers.
     User templates default to small priority numbers.  You can
     specify the priority of your template to insert it anywhere in the
     template search list.

     If there are multiple templates with the same context and name, the
     template with the lowest priority number will be used.

     If multiple files have the same priority, then then sort order is
     unpredictable.  If no template names match, then it doesn't matter.

`application'
     If a template file contains templates only needed for a particular
     application, then specify an application.  Template files for an
     application are stored in the template repository, but are not
     used in the generic template insertion case.

     The application with a particular name will access these templates
     from Lisp code.

   If you want to insert the characters that belong to the variables
`escape_start' or `escape_end', then place those into a variable.  For
example

     set escape_start "$"
     set escape_end "$"
     set DOLLAR "$"


File: srecode.info,  Node: Automatic Loop Variables,  Next: Compound Variable Values,  Prev: Special Variables,  Up: Variables

5.1.5 Automatic Loop Variables
------------------------------

When section macros are used, that section is repeated for each
subdictionary bound to the loop variable.

   Each dictionary added will automatically get values for positional
macros which will enable different SECTIONS.  The automatic section
variables are.

   * FIRST - The first entry in the table.

   * NOTFIRST - Not the first entry in the table.

   * LAST - The last entry in the table

   * NOTLAST - Not the last entry in the table.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Compound Variable Values,  Prev: Automatic Loop Variables,  Up: Variables

5.1.6 Compound Variable Values
------------------------------

A variable can also have a compound value.  This means the value of the
variable is an EIEIO object, which is a subclass of
`srecode-dictionary-compound-value'.

   Compound variables can only be setup from Lisp code.  See *Note
Compound Dictionary Values:: for details on setting up compound
variables from Lisp.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Templates,  Next: Contexts,  Prev: Variables,  Up: Template Writing

5.2 Templates
=============

A template represents a text pattern that can be inserted into a buffer.

   A basic template is declaired like this:

     template TEMPLATENAME :arg1 :arg2
     "Optional documentation string"
     ----
     The text to your template goes here.
     ----
     binding "a"

   Templates are stored in a template table by name, and are inserted by
the TEMPLATENAME provided.

   The documentation string is optional.  This documentation string will
be used to aid users in selecting which template they want to use.

   The code that makes up the raw template occurs between the lines that
contain the text "---".

* Menu:

* Template Section Dictionaries::  Template Scoped Macro values
* Template Macros::     Macros occuring in template patterns


File: srecode.info,  Node: Template Section Dictionaries,  Next: Template Macros,  Up: Templates

5.2.1 Template Section Dictionaries
-----------------------------------

To add variable values to section dictionaries used within a specific
template, you can add them to the beginning of the template declaration
like this:

     template TEMPLATENAME :arg1 :arg2
     "Optional documentation string"
     sectiondictionary "A"
     set NAME "foo"
     ----
     A beginning line {{NAME}}
     {{#A}}Optional string {{NAME}} here{{/A}}
     An end line
     ----

   In this example, the NAME macro gets the value "foo", but only while
it is inside section A.  The outer scoped NAME will be empty.

   This is particularly useful while using an include macro to pull in a
second template.  In this way, you can pass values known from one
template to a subordinate template where some value is not known.

   From the Emacs Lisp default template file, a syntax table is just a
variable with a specialized value.

   If a variable is declared like this:

     template variable :el
     "Inert a variable.
     DOC is optional."
     ----
     (defvar $?NAME$ $^$
       "$DOC$")
     ----

   then you can see that there is a NAME and DOC that is needed.  The
`^' point inserter is also a handy key here.

   The syntax table wants a variable, but knows the values of some of
these variables, and can recast the problem like this by using template
specific `sectiondictionary' macro declarations.

     template syntax-table
     "Create a syntax table."
     sectiondictionary "A"
     set NAME macro "?MODESYM" "-mode-syntax-table"
     set DOC "Syntax table used in " macro "?MODESYM" " buffers."
     ----
     $<A:variable$
       (let ((table (make-syntax-table (standard-syntax-table))))
         (modify-syntax-entry ?\; ". 12"  table) ;; SEMI, Comment start ;;
         ;; ...
         table)
     $/A$
     ----

   In this way, NAME can be set as a user posed question for MODESYM
with "-mode-syntax-table" appended.  A simplified doc string can also
be posed.

   Lastly, the A section contains more macro text which is inserted at
the `^' point marker.

   By creating useful base macros for things like function or variable
declarations, and recycling them in higher-order macros, an end user
can override the basic declarator, and the higher order macros will
then obey the new format, or perhaps even work in more than one major
mode.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Template Macros,  Prev: Template Section Dictionaries,  Up: Templates

5.2.2 Template Macros
---------------------

Template macros occur in the template text.  The default escape
characters are "{{" and "}}", though they can be changed in the
top-level variables.  See *Note Variables::.

   Thus, if you have the template code that looks like this:

     ;; Author: {{AUTHOR}}

   Then the text between {{ and }} are substituted by the value of the
macro AUTHOR.

   Macros can be specialized to be more than just a text string.  For
example, the macro above could be augmented with an Emacs Lisp function.

     ;; Author: {{AUTHOR:upcase}}

   In this case, the Emacs Lisp function "upcase" will be called on the
text value of the AUTHOR macro.

   Macros can also be specialized to have different behaviors by using a
prefix, non-alpha character or symbol.  For example:

     {{! This is a comment inside macro escape characters }}

   shows that the "!" symbol is for comments.

   Alternately, a macro could query the user during insertion:

     (defun {{?NAME}} ()
        {{^}}
        ) ;; End of {{NAME}}

   the "?" symbol indicates that if the symbol NAME isn't in the macro
dictionary, then the user should be queried for the NAME variable.  If
NAME appears again in the macro, the original value specified by the
user will be inserted again.

   If the text from a dictionary value is to be placed in column format,
you can use the "|" symbol to indicate you want column control.  For
example:

        | this | that |{{#A}}
        | {{|THIS:4}} | {{|THAT:4}} |{{/A}}

   For each repeated section "#A" the dictionary values for THIS and
THAT will be inserted and either trimmed to, or expanded to 4
characters in width.

   Macros that are prefixed with the "#" symbol denote a section.  A
macro of the same name with a "\\" prefix denotes the end of that
section.

     {{#MOOSE}}
     Here is some text describing moose.
     {{/MOOSE}}

   In this example if the section MOOSE was "shown" in the active
dictionary, then the text between the # and / macros will also be
inserted.

   All the text and macros within a section are either not shown at all
(if that section is not 'visible') or the section is is show one time
for each dictionary added to that symbol.  *Note Developing Template
Functions::.

   Macros prefixed with ">" will include another template.  Include
macros would look like this:

     {{>FOO:defun}}

   where `FOO' is the dictionary variable for the sub-dictionary used
for expanding the template `defun'.  The `defun' template will be
looked up in the template repository for the current mode, or in any
inherited modes.

   Another way to include another template is with the includewrap
insertion method, such as:

     {{<FOO:defun}}Handy Text goes here{{/FOO}}

   In this case, `defun' is included just as above.  If the `defun'
template has a {{^}} macro in it, then the section text "Handy Text
goes here" will be inserted at that point, and that location will not
be saved as the cursor location.

   If there is no {{^}}, then the text will not be inserted.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Contexts,  Next: Prompts,  Prev: Templates,  Up: Template Writing

5.3 Context
===========

Each template belongs to a context.  When promting for a template by
name, the name is prefixed by the current context.  If there is no
context, it defaults to `declaration'.

   You can change context like this:

     context NAME

   where NAME is some symbol that represents any context.

   A context resides over all templates that come after it until the
next context statement.  Thus:

     context C1

     template foo
     "Foo template in C1"
     ----
     ----

     context C2

     temlate foo
     "Foo template in C2"
     ----
     ----

   creates two `foo' templates.  The first one is when in context C1.
The second is available in context C2.

   This is useful if there are multiple ways to declair something like a
function or variable that differ only by where it is in the syntax of
the lanugage.  The name `foo' is not ambiguous because each is in a
different context.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Prompts,  Prev: Contexts,  Up: Template Writing

5.4 Prompt
==========

Some templates use promtping macro insertion.  A macro that needs a
prompt looks like this:

     {{?NAME}}

   where ? comes after the first escape character.

   by default, it will use a prompt like this when it is encountered:

     Specify NAME:

   For such macros, you can pre-define prompts for any dictionary entry.
When that dictionary entry is first encountered, the user is prompted,
and subsequent occurances of that dictionary entry use the same value.

   To get a different prompt, use a prompt command like this:

     prompt VARNAME "Nice Way to ask for VARNAME: "

   Now, if you put this in a template:

     template variable
     ----
     (defvar {{?VARNAME}} nil
        "")
     ----

   when VARNAME is encountered, it will use the nice prompt.

   Prompts can be extended as well.  For example:

     prompt VARNAME "VARNAME: " default "srecode" read y-or-n-p

   In this case, the `default' keyword indicates that `"srecode"' is
the default string to use, and `y-or-n-p' is the function to use to ask
the question.

   For `y-or-n-p' if you type "y" it inserts the default string,
otherwise it inserts empty.

   For any other symbol that occurs after the `read' token, it is
expected to take the same argument list as `read-string'.  As such, you
can create your own prompts that do completing reads on deterministic
values.

   To have the default be calculated later from a dictionary entry, you
need to use the `defaultmacro' keyword instead.

     prompt VARNAME "Varname: " defaultmacro "PREFIX"

   now, when it attempts to read in VARNAME, it will pre-populte the
text editing section with whatever the value of PREFIX is.

   Some language arguments may supply possible prefixes for prompts.
Look for these when creating your prompts.

6 Dictionaries
**************

Dictionaries contain sets of macros.  The values associated with the
macro names could be anything, but how it is handled is dependent on
the type of macro being inserted.

   Most of this chapter is for writing Lisp programs that use SRecode.
If you only want to write template files, then you only need to read
the *Note Template Argument Dictionary Entries:: section.

6.1 Create a Dictionary
=======================

 -- Function: srecode-create-dictionary &optional buffer
     Create a dictionary for BUFFER.  If BUFFER is not specified, use
     the current buffer.  The dictionary is initialized with no
     variables or enabled sections.  Any variables defined with `set'
     in the template, however, becomes a name in the dictionary.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Setting Dictionary Values,  Next: Compound Dictionary Values,  Prev: Create a Dictionary,  Up: Dictionaries

6.2 Setting Dictionary Values
=============================

When building an SRecode based application, you will need to setup your
dictionary values yourself.  There are several utility functions for
this.

   In the simplest form, you can assocate a string with a macro.

 -- Function: srecode-dictionary-set-value dict name value
     In dictionary DICT, set NAME to have VALUE.

   For section macros, you can have alternate values.  A section can
either be toggled as visible, or it can act as a loop.

 -- Function: srecode-dictionary-show-section dict name
     In dictionary DICT, indicate that the section NAME should be
     exposed.

 -- Function: srecode-dictionary-add-section-dictionary dict name
          &optional show-only
     In dictionary DICT, add a section dictionary for section macro
     NAME.  Return the new dictionary.

     You can add several dictionaries to the same section macro.  For
     each dictionary added to a macro, the block of codes in the
     template will be repeated.

     If optional argument SHOW-ONLY is non-`nil', then don't add a new
     dictionarly if there is already one in place.  Also, don't add
     FIRST/LAST entries.  These entries are not needed when we are just
     showing a section.

     Each dictionary added will automatically get values for positional
     macros which will enable SECTIONS to be enabled.

     * FIRST - The first entry in the table.   * NOTFIRST - Not the
     first entry in the table.   * LAST - The last entry in the table
     * NOTLAST - Not the last entry in the table.

     Adding a new dictionary will alter these values in previously
     inserted dictionaries.

6.3 Compound Dictionary Values
==============================

If you want to associate a non-string value with a dictionary macro,
then you will need to use a compound value.  Compound dictionary values
are derived using EIEIO from a base class for handling arbitrary data
in a macro.

 -- Type: srecode-dictionary-compound-value
     A compound dictionary value.  Values stored in a dictionary must
     be a STRING, a dictionary for showing sections, or an instance of
     a subclass of this class.

     Compound dictionary values derive from this class, and must
     provide a sequence of method implementations to convert into a
     string.

   Your new subclass of the compound value needs to implement these
methods:

 -- Function: srecode-compound-toString cp function dictionary
     Convert the compound dictionary value CP to a string.  If FUNCTION
     is non-`nil', then FUNCTION is somehow applied to an aspect of the
     compound value.  The FUNCTION could be a fraction of some function
     symbol with a logical prefix excluded.

   This method is for dumping out tables during debugging.

 -- Function: srecode-dump cp &optional indent
     Display information about this compound value.

   Here is an example of wrapping a semantic tag in a compound value:

     (defclass srecode-semantic-tag (srecode-dictionary-compound-value)
       ((prime :initarg :prime
     	  :type semantic-tag
     	  :documentation
     	  "This is the primary insertion tag.")
        )
       "Wrap up a collection of semantic tag information.
     This class will be used to derive dictionary values.")

     (defmethod srecode-compound-toString((cp srecode-semantic-tag)
     				     function
     				     dictionary)
       "Convert the compound dictionary value CP to a string.
     If FUNCTION is non-nil, then FUNCTION is somehow applied to an
     aspect of the compound value."
       (if (not function)
           ;; Just format it in some handy dandy way.
           (semantic-format-tag-prototype (oref cp :prime))
         ;; Otherwise, apply the function to the tag itself.
         (funcall function (oref cp :prime))
         ))

6.4 Argument Resolution
=======================

Some dictionary entries can be set via template arguments in the
template declaration.  For examples of template arguments, see *Note
Template Argument Dictionary Entries::.

   You can resolve an argument list into a dictionary with:

 -- Function: srecode-resolve-arguments temp dict
     Resolve all the arguments needed by the template TEMP.  Apply
     anything learned to the dictionary DICT.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Creating new Arguments,  Next: Template Argument Dictionary Entries,  Prev: Argument Resolution,  Up: Dictionaries

6.5 Creating new Arguments
==========================

You can create new arguments for use in template files by writing new
Emacs Lisp functions.  Doing so is easy.  Here is an example for the
`:user' argument:

     (defun srecode-semantic-handle-:user (dict)
       "Add macros into the dictionary DICT based on the current :user."
       (srecode-dictionary-set-value dict "AUTHOR" (user-full-name))
       (srecode-dictionary-set-value dict "LOGIN" (user-login-name))
        ;; ...
       )

   In this case, a function with the name prefix
`srecode-semantic-handle-' that ends in `:user' creates a new argument
`:user' that can be used in a template.

   Your argument handler must take one argument DICT, which is the
dictionary to fill in.  Inside your function, you can do whatever you
want, but adding dictionary values is the right thing.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Template Argument Dictionary Entries,  Prev: Creating new Arguments,  Up: Dictionaries

6.6 Template Argument Dictionary Entries
========================================

When a dictionary is initialized for a template, then the dictionary
will be initialized with a predefined set of macro values.

   A template of the form:

     template template-name :arg1 :arg2
     ----
     Your template goes here
     ----

   specifies two arguments :arg1, and :arg2.

   The following built-in simple arguments are available:

* Menu:

* Base Arguments::
* Semantic Arguments::
* Language Arguments::


File: srecode.info,  Node: Base Arguments,  Next: Semantic Arguments,  Up: Template Argument Dictionary Entries

6.6.1 Base Arguments
--------------------

6.6.1.1 Argument :indent
........................

Supplies the `INDENT' macro.  When `INDENT' is non-nil, then each line
is individually indented with `indent-according-to-mode' during macro
processing.

6.6.2 Argument :blank
---------------------

Specifying this argument adds a special `:blank' handler at the
beginning and end of the template.  This handler will insert `\n' if
the insertion point is not on a line by itself.

6.6.2.1 Argument :region
........................

If there is an active region via `transient-mark-mode', or
`mouse-drag-region', then the `REGION' section will be enabled.

   In addition, `REGIONTEXT' will be set the the text in the region,
and that region of text will be "killed" from the current buffer.

   If standard-output is NOT the current buffer, then the region will
not be deleted.  In this way, you can safely use `:region' using
templates in arbitrary output streams.

6.6.2.2 Argument :user
......................

Sets up variables about the current user.

`AUTHOR'
     Value of the Emacs function `user-full-name'

`EMAIL'
     Current Emacs users email address.

`LOGIN'
     Current Emacs users login name.

`UID'
     Current Emacs users login name.

`EMACSINITFILE'
     This Emacs sessions' init file.

6.6.2.3 Argument :time
......................

Sets up variables with the current date and time.

`YEAR'
     The current year.

`MONTH'
     The current month as a number.

`MONTHNAME'
     The current month name, unabbreviated.

`DAY'
     The current day as a number.

`WEEKDAY'
     The current day of the week as an abbreviated name

`HOUR'
     The current hour in 24 hour format.

`HOUR12'
     The current hour in 12 hour format.

`AMPM'
     Locale equivalent of AM or PM.  Usefule with HOUR12.

`MINUTE'
     The current minute.

`SECOND'
     The current second.

`TIMEZONE'
     The timezone string.

`DATE'
     The Locale supported date (%D).

`TIME'
     The Locale supported time format (%X).

6.6.2.4 Argument :file
......................

Sets up variables with details about the current file.

`FILENAME'
     The filename with out the directory part of the current buffer.

`FILE'
     The filename with out the directory or extension

`EXTENSION'
     The filename extension.

`DIRECTORY'
     The directory in which the current buffer resides.

`MODE'
     Major mode of this buffer.

`SHORTMODE'
     Major mode of this buffer without "-mode".  Useful for inserting
     the Emacs mode specifier.

`section RCS'
     Show the section RCS if there is a CVS or RCS directory here.

6.6.2.5 Argument :system
........................

Sets up variables with computer system information.

`SYSTEMCONF'
     The "system-configuration".

`SYSTEMTYPE'
     The "system-type".

`SYSTEMNAME'
     The "system-name".

`MAILHOST'
     The name of the machine Emacs derived mail "comes from".

6.6.2.6 Argument :kill
......................

`KILL'
     The top-most item from the kill ring.

`KILL2'
     The second item in the kill ring.

`KILL3'
     The third item in the kill ring.

`KILL4'
     The fourth item in the kill ring.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Semantic Arguments,  Next: Language Arguments,  Prev: Base Arguments,  Up: Template Argument Dictionary Entries

6.6.3 Semantic Arguments
------------------------

6.6.3.1 Argument :tag
.....................

The :tag argument is filled in with information from Semantic.  The tag
in question is queried from the senator tag ring, or pressed in from
SRecode utilities that use tags in templates.

`TAG'
     This is a compound value for the tag in the current senator kill
     ring, or something handled via the variable
     `srecode-semantic-selected-tag'.

      -- Variable: srecode-semantic-selected-tag
          The tag selected by a `:tag' template argument.  If this is
          `nil', then `senator-tag-ring' is used.

     Use the function part of a macro insert to extract obscure parts
     of the tag.

`NAME'
     The name of the tag as a string.

`TYPE'
     The data type of the tag as a string.

   If TAG is a function, you will get these additional dictionary
entries.

`ARGS'
     A Loop macro value.  Each argument is inserted in ARGS.  To create
     a comma separated list of arguments, you might do this:

          {{#ARGS}}{{TYPE}} {{NAME}}{{#NOTLAST}},{{/NOTLAST}}{{/ARGS}}

     Within the section dictionaries for each argument, you will find
     both NAME and TYPE, in addition to the automatic section values
     for FIRST, LAST, NOTFIRST, and NOTLAST.

`PARENT'
     The string name of the parent of this function, if the function is
     a method of some class.

`THROWS'
     In each THROWS entry, the NAME of the signal thrown is specified.

   If TAG is a variable, you will get these dictionary entries.

`DEFAULTVALUE'
     Enabled if there is a VALUE.

`VALUE'
     An entry in the HAVEDEFAULT subdictionary that represents the
     textual representation of the default value of this variable.

   If TAG is a datatype, you will get these dictionary entries.

`PARENTS'
     Section dictionaries for the parents of this class.  Each parent
     will have a NAME.

`INTERFACES'
     Section dictionaries for all the implemented interfaces of this
     class.  Each interface will have a NAME.

   Note that data type templates should always have a `{{^}}' macro in
it where the core contents of that type will go.  This is why data
types don't have subdictionaries full of the slots in the classes or
structs.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Language Arguments,  Prev: Semantic Arguments,  Up: Template Argument Dictionary Entries

6.6.4 language Arguments
------------------------

Each language typically has it's own argument.  These arguments can be
used to fill in language specific values that will be useful.

6.6.4.1 Argument :srt
.....................

Used for SRecoder template files.

`ESCAPE_START'
     The characters used for an escape start

`ESCAPE_END'
     The characters used for an escape end

6.6.4.2 Argument :cpp
.....................

`HEADER'
     Shows this section if the current file is a header file.

`NOTHEADER'
     The opposite of `HEADER'.

`FILENAME_SYMBOL'
     The current filename reformatted as a C friendly symbol.

6.6.5 Argument :java
--------------------

`FILENAME_AS_PACKAGE'
     Converts the filename into text that would be suitable as a package
     name.

`FILENAME_AS_CLASS'
     Converts the filename into text that would be suitable as a
     class-name for the main class in the file.

6.6.5.1 Argument :el
....................

Sets `PRENAME'.  This would be a common prefix from all the tags in the
current buffer.

   Most Emacs Lisp packages have some common prefix used in a way
similar to namespaces in other languages.

6.6.5.2 Argument :el-custom
...........................

`GROUP'
     The name of the Emacs Custom group that instances of `defcustom'
     ought to use.

`FACEGROUP'
     The name of the Emacs Custom group that faces delcared with
     `defface' ought to use.

6.6.5.3 Argument :texi
......................

`LEVEL'
     The current section level, such as `chapter' or `section'.

`NEXTLEVEL'
     The next level down, so if `LEVEL' is `chapter', then `NEXTLEVEL'
     would be `section'.

6.6.5.4 Argument :texitag
.........................

The `:texitag' argument is like the `:tag' argument, except that
additional variable `TAGDOC' is provided for each tag.

   The `TAGDOC' is filled with derived documentation from the tag in
question, and that documentation is also reformatted to be mostly
texinfo compatible.

7 Developing Template Functions
*******************************

You can develop your own custom template insertion functions.  Doing so
is relatively simple, and requires that you write an Emacs Lisp command.

   If the built in commands don't provide enough options, you will need
to write your own function in order to provide your dictionaries with
the values needed for custom templates.

   In this way, you can build your own code generator for any language
based on a set of predefined macros whos values you need to derive from
Emacs Lisp code yourself.

   For example:

     (defun my-srecode-insert (template-name)
       "Inesrt the template TEMPLATE-NAME into the current buffer at point."

       ;; Read in a template name.
       (interactive (list (srecode-read-template-name "Template Name: ")))
       (if (not srecode-table)
           (error "No template table found for mode %s" major-mode))
       (let ((temp (srecode-template-get-table srecode-table template-name))

            ;; Creawte a new dictionary
     	(newdict (srecode-create-dictionary)))

         (if (not temp)
     	(error "No Template named %s" template-name))

         ;; Add some values into the dictionary!
         (srecode-dictionary-set-value newdict "FOO" (my-get-value-of-foo))
         ;; Optionally show a section
         (srecode-dictionary-show-section newdict "BLARG")

         ;; Add in several items over a loop
         (let ((my-stuff (get-my-stuff-list)))
            (while my-stuff
               (let ((subdict (srecode-dictionary-add-section-dictionary
                                  newdict "LOOP")))
                  (srecode-dictionary-set-value subdict "NAME" (nth 0 my-stuff))
                  (srecode-dictionary-set-value subdict "ARG" (nth 1 my-stuff))
                  (srecode-dictionary-set-value subdict "MOOSE" (nth 2 my-stuff))
                  )
               (setq my-stuff (cdr my-stuff)))

         ;; Some templates have arguments that need to be resolved.
         (srecode-resolve-arguments temp newdict)

         ;; Do the expansion
         (srecode-insert-fcn temp newdict)
         ))

   Lets look at the key functions involved above:

7.1 Interactive Completion:
===========================

 -- Function: srecode-read-template-name prompt
     Completing read for Semantic Recoder template names.  PROMPT is
     used to query for the name of the template desired.

7.2 Template Insertion Commands
===============================

There are several ways to insert a template.  It is easiest to just
start with the main entry point.

 -- Function: srecode-insert-fcn template dictionary &optional stream
     Insert TEMPLATE using DICTIONARY into STREAM.  If STREAM is nil,
     then use the current buffer.

8 Template Naming Conventions
*****************************

For SRecode to work across langauges reliably, templates need to follow
a predictable pattern.  For every language of similar nature (OO,
functional, doc based) if they all provide the same base templates,
then an application can be written against the base templates, and it
will work in each of the supported language.

   Having consistent templates also makes it easy to use those templates
from a user perspective during basic interactive insertion via
`srecode-minor-mode'.

   NOTES ON THIS CHAPTER:

   These conventions are being worked on.  Check w/ CEDET-DEVEL mailing
list if you want to support a language, or write an application and
provide your opinions on this topic.  Any help is appreciated.

8.1 Context: File
=================

Each language should support the `file:empty' template.  This will
generally use the default copyright insertion mechanism.

8.2 Context: Declaration
========================

Functional languages should attempt to support the folowing:

`function'
     A standalone function.  Not a method, external method, or other.

`method'
     A method belonging to some class declaired outside the textual
     bounds of that class' declaration.

`variable'
     A global variable.

`type'
     A data type.  If the language supports several types of datatypes
     then do not use this, use more specific ones instead.

`class'
     For OO languages, use this instead of `type'.

`include'
     Include files.

   For any semantic tag class in your language, you will likely want to
have a corresponding template.

   In order for the SRecode function `srecode-semantic-insert-tag' to
work, you can create templates similar to those mentioned above, except
with `-tag' appended to the end.  This lets a template like `function'
have user conveniences when referencing `function-tag', while also
allowing the tag inserter to do it's job with a simpler template.

8.3 Context: Classdef
=====================

Inside a class definition.  These are to be inserted inside the textual
bounds of a class declaration.

`function'
     This would be a method of the class being inserted into.

`constructor'
`destructor'
     Like `function' but specific to alloc/delete of an object.

`variable'
     This would be a field of the class being inserted into.

8.4 Context: Code
=================

Inside a body of code, such as a function or method body.

   - no conventions yet.

8.5 Standard Macro Values
=========================

For these macros to be useful, standard macro names should be used.
These values could be provided directly from a Semantic tag, or by an
application.

NAME
     The name of the declaration being created.

PARENT
     If the item belongs to some parent type, it would be the full name
     of that type, including namespaces.

TYPE
     A datatype name for a variable, or the return value of a function.

DOC
     If there is some documentation associated with the item, then DOC
     should contain the value.  (Optional)

ARGS
     The ARGS macro defines a section for 0 or more arguments to a
     function or method.  Each entry in ARGS will follow the rest of
     these naming conventions, such as for NAME and TYPE.

   For templates used by `srecode-semantic-insert-tag', there is also
the following useful macro values.

TAG
     A special insertion value TAG.  You can use semantic functions to
     turn the tag into a string.

HAVEDEFAULT
DEFAULT
     Default value for a variable.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Inserting Tag Lists,  Next: Application Writing,  Prev: Template Naming Conventions,  Up: Top

9 Inserting Tag Lists
*********************

Since SRecode is the Semantic Recoder, the ultimate goal for SRecode is
to convert lists of tags, as produced by semantic back into code.

   A single function provides the interface for programs to do this, but
it requires any particular language to have provided the correct
templates to make it work.

 -- Function: srecode-semantic-insert-tag tag &optional style-option
          point-insert-fcn &rest dict-entries
     Insert TAG into a buffer useing srecode templates at point.

     Optional STYLE-OPTION is a list of minor configuration of styles,
     such as the symbol `'prototype' for prototype functions, or
     `'system' for system includes, and `'doxygen', for a doxygen style
     comment.

     Optional third argument POINT-INSERT-FCN is a hook that is run
     after TAG is inserted that allows an opportunity to fill in the
     body of some thing.  This hook function is called with one
     argument, the TAG being inserted.

     The rest of the arguments are DICT-ENTRIES.  DICT-ENTRIES is of
     the form ( NAME1 VALUE1 NAME2 VALUE2 ... NAMEn VALUEn).

     The exact template used is based on the current context.  The
     template used is found within the toplevel context as calculated
     by "srecode-calculate-context", such as `declaration', `classdecl',
     or `code'.

     For various conditions, this function looks for a template with
     the name CLASS-tag, where CLASS is the tag class.  If it cannot
     find that, it will look for that template in the
     `declaration'context (if the current context was not
     `declaration').

     If PROTOTYPE is specified, it will first look for templates with
     the name CLASS-tag-prototype, or CLASS-prototype as above.

     See "srecode-semantic-apply-tag-to-dict" for details on what is in
     the dictionary when the templates are called.

     This function returns to location in the buffer where the inserted
     tag ENDS, and will leave point inside the inserted text based on
     any occurance of a point-inserter.  Templates such as "function"
     will leave point where code might be inserted.

10 Application Writing
**********************

The main goal of SRecode is to provide a strong platform for writing
code generating applications.

   Any templates that are application specific should make an
application declaration for each template file they use.  This prevents
those templates from being used outside of that application.

   For example, add this to a file:
     set application "getset"

   In your application Emacs Lisp code, you would then load those
templates.  A typical initialization would look like this:

       (srecode-load-tables-for-mode major-mode)
       (srecode-load-tables-for-mode major-mode 'getset)

   These two lines will load in the base templates for the major mode,
and then the application specific templates.

 -- Function: srecode-load-tables-for-mode mmode &optional appname
     Load all the template files for MMODE.  Templates are found in the
     SRecode Template Map.  See "srecode-get-maps" for more.  APPNAME
     is the name of an application.  In this case, all template files
     for that application will be loaded.

   todo - Add examples.  Most core stuff is already described above.
