   EDE is a collection of definitions called the _Emacs Development
Extensions_.  EDE provides the gloss that simplifies the learning curve
for all the very useful functionality of building and debugging under
emacs.  In doing so it attempts to emulate a typical IDE (Integrated
Development Environment).  What this means is that EDE can manage or
create your makefiles and other building environment duties so the
developer can concentrate on code, and not support files.  In doing so,
it will be much easier for new programmers to learn and adopt the GNU
ways of doing things.

1 EDE Project Concepts
**********************

EDE is a generic interface for managing projects.  In other words,
there is one set of menus and keybindings specified by EDE, but there
are multiple ways a project can be expressed via a build system.

   You can learn about multiple *Note Project types::, or the specific
build or debug commands in other chapters.

   In EDE, a project hierarchy matches a directory hierarchy.  There
would be a project root, and subprojects in different subdirectories.

   Within each project, there can be multiple targets.  A target at the
simplest level is a named collection of files within a project.  There
are two important reasons for specifying a target.

  1. A collection of files to be added to a distribution.

  2. A collection of files that can be built into something else.

   If you intend to write code, and have it tarred up and distributed
under the GPL, all important files must be a part of some target so
that they will be added to the distribution file.

   Targets that are lists of files that can be built into something else
will also be distributed, but the build process will also convert those
files into some specified built thing, such as a program or compiled
documentation.

   Lastly, EDE provides a way for other tools to easily learn file
associations.  For example, a program might need to restrict some sort
of search to files in a single target, or need to discover the location
of documentation or interface files.  EDE can provide this information.

2 EDE Mode
**********

EDE is implemented as a minor-mode, which augments other modes such as C
mode, and Texinfo mode.  You can turn EDE on for all buffers by running
the command `global-ede-mode', or by putting this in your `~/.emacs'
file.

     (global-ede-mode t)

   When EDE is active for a given buffer, the menu item "Project"
appears.  This menu contains several high-level functions to make
working on a code set easier.  These items and keybindings never change
regardless of the type of project you are actually working on.

   The `ede.el' file is a minimal set of loading routines.  When
different types of projects are encountered, source code for those
projects are loaded at that time.


File: ede.info,  Node: Creating a project,  Next: Modifying your project,  Prev: EDE Mode,  Up: Top

3 Creating a project
********************

To create a new project, first load a file you would want in that
project into a buffer.  If you have a hierarchy of directories, choose
a file in the topmost directory first.  From this buffer, run `ede-new'.

   EDE can support several types of projects.  When creating a new
project with the command `ede-new' you must choose the type of project
you would like to create.  *Note Project types::.

   Each type has it's own benefits or language specific enhancements.
You will be prompted for the type of project you would like to create.
The simplest and most language agnostic project type is _Make_.  A
derivation of this is the `Automake' type.

   Not all project types can be created in this way.  For example, there
are two ways to handle Automake based projects.  One is by making an
_Automake_ project with `ede-new'.  The other is to just write some
automake files which EDE will automatically detect, and put you into a
different Automake mode.  Any GNU project using Automake will be
detected in this way, and you can use EDE to modify those Makefiles for
you.

   If you just want to use EDE to know about a project so that other
libraries, such as semantic, can take advantage of some core EDE APIs,
then you can use some simpler projects.  See  *Note Simple projects::.

3.1 Creating a subproject
=========================

A subproject is merely a project in a subdirectory of another project.
You can create a subproject by using the `ede-new' command (or `"Create
Project"' from the menu) while a in a subdirectory below an existing
project.  This new project will be automatically added to the parent
project, and will be automatically loaded when the parent is read.

   When using a project command that involves a makefile, EDE uses the
top-most project's makefile as a starting place for the build.  How the
toplevel project handles subprojects in the build process is dependent
on that project's type.

4 Modifying your project
************************

Your project and targets are systems with lots of options.  Generic
features are listed here.  You will need to read sections on specific
project types for detailed information on the project you might be
using.

* Menu:

* Add/Remove target::
* Add/Remove files::
* Customize Features::
* EDE Project Features::


File: ede.info,  Node: Add/Remove target,  Next: Add/Remove files,  Prev: Modifying your project,  Up: Modifying your project

4.1 Add/Remove target
=====================

A project with no targets isn't very useful, so you can use EDE to add
and remove targets from your project.

   You can create a new target with the `ede-new-target' command `C-c .
t'.  If appropriate you will be given the option to add the current
buffer into the newly created target.

   When creating a target, you will be given an option list of target
types.  Each target type will have its own build process and class of
files it will accept.

   You can remove a target with the command `ede-delete-target'.

   The add and remove commands are in the `Project->Project Options'
menu.


File: ede.info,  Node: Add/Remove files,  Next: Customize Features,  Prev: Add/Remove target,  Up: Modifying your project

4.2 Add/Remove files
====================

A target with no files isn't very useful, so you can use EDE to add and
remove files to targets.  Sometimes files can belong to multiple
targets, and that is OK.

   You can add files into targets with the command `ede-add-file' bound
to `C-c . a'.   If there are no targets created that you wish to use,
you can type in `new target' to create a new target apropriate for the
file you are adding.

   You can remove files from a target with the `ede-remove-file' bound
to `C-c . d'.  If the file is in multiple targets, it will query for
every target it could be removed from.

   When you are working in a project, if you load a new file into a
buffer that is not a part of an active target, EDE will automatically
remind you to add it to a target of your choosing.  If you do not wish
to add it to a target, you can choose `none'.  You can customize the
behavior with the variable `ede-auto-add-method'.


File: ede.info,  Node: Customize Features,  Next: EDE Project Features,  Prev: Add/Remove files,  Up: Modifying your project

4.3 Customize Features
======================

A project, and it's targets, are objects using the `EIEIO' object
system. *Note (eieio)EIEIO::.  These objects have data fields containing
important information related to your work.

   If the high-level functions aren't enough, you can tweak all
user-customizable fields at any time by running the command
`customize-project' or `customize-target'.  This will load the current
project or target into a _customization buffer_ where you tweak
individual slots.  This is usually necessary for project modes that are
very complex.

   Some project modes do not have a project file, but directly read a
Makefile, or existing file.  Instead of letting you directly edit the
object, you can edit the file.  Use the command `ede-edit-file-target'
bound to `C-c . e'.


File: ede.info,  Node: EDE Project Features,  Prev: Customize Features,  Up: Modifying your project

4.4 EDE Project Features
========================

This section details user facing features of an EDE `Make' style
project.  The specified options may be the same as in a `Automake'
project, but are not the same as in an direct Automake project.

   To modify any of the specific features mentioned here, you need to
customize the project or target with `customize-project' or
`customize-target'.

   When you are customizing, you are directly manipulating slot values
in EIEIO objects.  If you are interested in additional details, see
*Note Extending EDE::

* Menu:

* Changing Compilers and Flags::
* Configurations::


File: ede.info,  Node: Changing Compilers and Flags,  Next: Configurations,  Prev: EDE Project Features,  Up: EDE Project Features

4.4.1 Changing Compilers and Flags
----------------------------------

Targets that build stuff need compilers.  To change compilers, you need
to customize the desired target.

   In the `[Make]' section, you can then choose a new compiler or
linker from the list.  If a linker you need is not available, you will
need to create a new one.  *Note Compiler and Linker objects::.

   If an existing compiler or linker is close, but you need to modify
some flag set such as adding an include path you will need to add a
configuration variable.

   To start, you should create the basic setup, and construct a makefile
with `ede-proj-regenerate'.  Look in the `Makefile' to see what
commands are inserted.  Once you have determined the variable you need
to modify, you can add a configuration for it.  *Note Configurations::.


File: ede.info,  Node: Configurations,  Prev: Changing Compilers and Flags,  Up: EDE Project Features

4.4.2 Configurations
--------------------

Configurations specify different ways to build a project.  For example,
you may configure a project to be in "debug" mode, or perhaps in
"release" mode.

   The project, and each target type all have a slot named
`configuration-variables'.  To add new variables to a configuration
find this slot in the custom buffer, and insert a new configuration.
Name it either "debug" or "release", then insert some number of
name/value pairs to it.

   You can have any number of valid configurations too.  To add a new
configuration, customize your project.  Work in the `[Settings]' block
for "configurations".  Add a new named configuration here.

   To switch between different active configurations, modify the
"configuration default" slot.

5 Building and Debugging
************************

EDE assumes you are writing some sort of program, so it attempts to
facilitate this activity.  EDE will associate the current buffer with a
target.  The target then knows how to compile or debug the given source
file.

   The following commands enable compilation and debugging.

`C-c . c'
     Compile the current target.

`C-c . C'
     Compile the entire project.

`c-c . D'
     Debug the current target.

`ede-make-dist'
     Build a distribution file for your project.

   These commands, plus project or target specific options are available
in the `Project' menu.


File: ede.info,  Node: Miscellaneous commands,  Next: Project types,  Prev: Building and Debugging,  Up: Top

6 Miscellaneous commands
************************

6.1 Rescan
==========

If you opt to go in and edit EDE project files directly, perhaps with
the `ede-edit-file-target', you will need to have Emacs rescan the
project files to update the internal data structures.

   Use `ede-rescan-toplevel' bound to `C-c . g' to refresh your system.

6.2 EDE Find File
=================

EDE can help you find files in your project.  Use `ede-find-file' bound
to `C-c . f'.  It will prompt you for a name.  You can specify the name
without a directory.  EDE will try to find a file with that name
somewhere in your project.

   EDE can use external tools to help with file finding.  Configure the
variable `ede-locate-setup-options' to help EDE find external tools.

 -- Variable: ede-locate-setup-options
     List of locate objects to try out by default.  Listed in order of
     preference.  If the first item cannot be used in a particular
     project, then the next one is tried.  It is always assumed that
     "ede-locate-base" is at end of the list.

6.3 Speedbar
============

EDE also supports the speedbar package.  While speedbar works great
against directories already, EDE provides a project display mode.  This
lets you look at your source files as they are structured in your
project.  Thus, where many files may be clumped together in one
directory, the Project view will provide a hierarchical view of your
files as grouped by target.

   You can activate speedbar in this mode with the command
`ede-speedbar'.  This is bound to `C-c . s'.


File: ede.info,  Node: Project types,  Next: Extending EDE,  Prev: Miscellaneous commands,  Up: Top

7 Project types
***************

There are currently three types of project modes.  One is
`ede-project', and shows up as `Make' and `Automake' when creating new
projects.

   The other project type handles automake projects directly from the
automake files.  EDE cannot make new projects of this type, assuming
the user will do it themselves.  Use `ede-project' in `Automake' mode
to have EDE create `Makefile.am' file, and a `configure.in' file.

   The third project style are "Simple" projects.  If you already have
project infrastructure for building and debugging, you can instead
create a simple project that identifies a project root and can look up
files.  The simple project styles are useful for working with tools
that use EDE to look up files.

* Menu:

* Make and Automake projects::  Project types of `ede-project'
* Automake direct projects::    Project interface on hand-written automake files.
* Simple projects::             Projects EDE doesn't manage.


File: ede.info,  Node: Make and Automake projects,  Next: Automake direct projects,  Up: Project types

7.1 Make and Automake projects
==============================

A project of `ede-project' type creates a file called `Project.ede' in
every project directory.  This is used to track your configuration
information.  If you configure this project to be in `Makefile' mode,
then this project will autogenerate a `Makefile'.  If you configure it
in `Automake' mode a `Makefile.am' file will be created.  The automake
bootstrapping routines will also import and maintain a configure.am
script and a host of other files required by Automake.


File: ede.info,  Node: Automake direct projects,  Next: Simple projects,  Prev: Make and Automake projects,  Up: Project types

7.2 Automake direct projects
============================

The project type that reads `Makefile.am' directly is derived from the
sources of the original `project-am.el' mode that was distributed
independently.  This mode eventually became EDE.  The `project-am'
project will read existing automake files, but will not generate them
automatically, or create new ones.  As such, it is useful as a browsing
tool, or as maintenance in managing file lists.


File: ede.info,  Node: Simple projects,  Prev: Automake direct projects,  Up: Project types

7.3 Simple Projects
===================

There can be a wide array of Simple projects.  The root for simple
projects is the class `ede-simple-project'.  This handles the
infrastructure of storing a .ede file if needed.

   The class `ede-simple-project' is designed to be subclassed.  Then
key EDE methods can be overridden to provide a quick wrapper over any
project.

   A second project type is `ede-cpp-root'.  This project type is
designed to be created for a directory hierarchy full of C/C++ code.
It can be configured with minimal lisp knowledge to do header file
lookup for semantic, improving code completion performance.

* Menu:

* ede-cpp-root::        This project marks the root of a C/C++ code project.
* ede-simple subclassing:: Create your own simple project.
* ede-emacs::		A project for working with Emacs.
* ede-linux::		A project for working with Linux kernels.
* Custom Locate::       Customizing how to locate files in a simple project


File: ede.info,  Node: ede-cpp-root,  Next: ede-simple subclassing,  Up: Simple projects

7.3.1 ede-cpp-root
------------------

The `ede-cpp-root' project type will allow you to create a single
object with no save-file in your `.emacs' file.  It will allow EDE to
provide semantic with the ability to find header files quickly.

   The `ede-cpp-root' class knows a few things about C++ projects, such
as the prevalence of "include" directories, and typical file-layout
stuff.  If this isn't sufficient, you can subclass
`ede-cpp-root-project' and add your own tweaks in just a few lines.
See the end of this file for an example.

   In the most basic case, add this to your `.emacs' file, modifying
appropriate bits as needed.

     (ede-cpp-root-project "SOMENAME" :file "/dir/to/some/file")

   Replace SOMENAME with whatever name you want, and the filename to an
actual file at the root of your project.  It might be a Makefile, a
README file.  Whatever.  It doesn't matter.  It's just a key to hang
the rest of EDE off of.

   The most likely reason to create this project, is to speed up
searching for includes files, or to simplify bootstrapping semantic's
ability to find files without much user interaction.  In conjunction
with semantic completion, having a short include path is key.  You can
override the default include path and system include path like this:

     (ede-cpp-root-project "NAME" :file "FILENAME"
         :include-path '( "/include" "../include" "/c/include" )
         :system-include-path '( "/usr/include/c++/3.2.2/" )
         :spp-table '( ("MOOSE" . "")
                       ("CONST" . "const") ) )

   In this case each item in the include path list is searched.  If the
directory starts with "/", then that expands to the project root
directory.  If a directory does not start with "/", then it is relative
to the default-directory of the current buffer when the file name is
expanded.

   The include path only affects C/C++ header files.  Use the slot
`:header-match-regexp' to change it.

   The `:system-include-path' allows you to specify full directory
names to include directories where system header files can be found.
These will be applied to files in this project only.

   The `:spp-table' provides a list of project specific #define style
macros that are unique to this project, passed in to the compiler on
the command line, or are in special headers.  See the
`semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-map' for more on how to format this
entry.

   If there is a single file in your project, you can instead set the
`:spp-files' to a list of file names relative to the root of your
project.  Specifying this is like setting the variable
`semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-file' in semantic.

   If you want to override the file-finding tool with your own function
you can do this:

     (ede-cpp-root-project "NAME" :file "FILENAME" :locate-fcn 'MYFCN)

   Where MYFCN is a symbol for a function.  The locate function can be
used in place of `ede-expand-filename' so you can quickly customize
your custom target to use specialized local routines instead of the
default EDE routines.  The function symbol must take two arguments:

NAME
     The name of the file to find.

DIR
     The directory root for this cpp-root project.

   If the cpp-root project style is right for you, but you want a
dynamic loader, instead of hard-coding path name values in your
`.emacs', you can do that too, but you will need to write some lisp
code.

   To do that, you need to add an entry to the
`ede-project-class-files' list, and also provide two functions to teach
EDE how to load your project pattern

   It would look like this:

     (defun MY-FILE-FOR-DIR (&optional dir)
       "Return a full file name to the project file stored in DIR."
       <write your code here, or return nil>
       )

     (defun MY-ROOT-FCN ()
       "Return the root fcn for `default-directory'"
       ;; You might be able to use `ede-cpp-root-project-root'
       ;; and not write this at all.
       )

     (defun MY-LOAD (dir)
       "Load a project of type `cpp-root' for the directory DIR.
     Return nil if there isn't one."
       ;; Use your preferred constructin method here.
       (ede-cpp-root-project "NAME" :file (expand-file-name "FILE" dir)
                                    :locate-fcn 'MYFCN)
       )

     (add-to-list 'ede-project-class-files
     	     (ede-project-autoload "cpp-root"
     	      :name "CPP ROOT"
     	      :file 'ede-cpp-root
     	      :proj-file 'MY-FILE-FOR-DIR
                   :proj-root 'MY-ROOT-FCN
     	      :load-type 'MY-LOAD
     	      :class-sym 'ede-cpp-root)
     	     t)

   This example only creates an auto-loader, and does not create a new
kind of project.

parsing, and has an optimized include file identification function.


File: ede.info,  Node: Custom Locate,  Prev: ede-linux,  Up: Simple projects

7.3.5 Custom Locate
-------------------

The various simple project styles all have one major drawback, which is
that the files in the project are not completely known to EDE.  When
the EDE API is used to try and file files by some reference name in the
project, then that could fail.

   @TODO - Add ID Utils and CScope examples

   EDE can therefore use some external locate commands, such as the unix
"locate" command, or "GNU Global".

   Configuration of the tool you want to use such as `locate', or
`global' will need to be done without the aid of EDE.  Once configured,
however, EDE can use it.

   To enable one of these tools, set the variable
`ede-locate-setup-options' with the names of different locate objects.
*Note Miscellaneous commands::.

   Configure this in your `.emacs' before loading in CEDET or EDE.  If
you want to add support for GNU Global, your configuration would look
like this:

     (setq ede-locate-setup-options '(ede-locate-global ede-locate-base))

   That way, when a search needs to be done, it will first try using
GLOBAL.  If global is not available for that directory, then it will
revert to the base locate object.  The base object always fails to find
a file.

   You can add your own locate tool but subclassing from
`ede-locate-base'.  The subclass should also implement two methods.
See the code in `ede-locate.el' for GNU Global as a simple example.

8 Extending EDE
***************

This chapter is intended for users who want to write new parts or fix
bugs in EDE.  A knowledge of Emacs Lisp, and some EIEIO(CLOS) is
required.

   EDE's dependency on EIEIO, the CLOS package for Emacs lets EDE define
two object superclasses, specifically the PROJECT and TARGET.  All
commands in EDE are usually meant to address the current project, or
current target.

   All specific projects in EDE derive subclasses of the EDE
superclasses.  In this way, specific behaviors such as how a project is
saved, or how a target is compiled can be customized by a project
author in detail.  EDE communicates to these project objects via an API
using methods.  The commands you use in EDE mode are high-level
functional wrappers over these methods.  For details on different types
of projects, *Note Project types::.  *Note (eieio)Top::. For details on
using EIEIO to extending classes, and writing methods.

   If you intend to extend EDE, it is most likely that a new target
type is needed in one of the existing project types.  The rest of this
chapter will discuss extending the `ede-project' class, and it's
targets.  See `project-am.el' for basic details on adding targets to it.

   For the `ede-project' type, the core target class is called
`ede-proj-target'.  Inheriting from this will give you everything you
need to start, including adding your sources into the makefile.  If you
also need additional rules in the makefile, you will want to inherit
from `ede-proj-target-makefile' instead.  You may want to also add new
fields to track important information.

   If you are building currently unsupported code into a program or
shared library, it is unlikely you need a new target at all.  Instead
you would need to create a new compiler or linker object that compiles
source code of the desired type. *Note Compiler and Linker objects::.

   Once your new class exists, you will want to fill in some basic
methods.  See the `ede-skel.el' file for examples of these.  The files
`ede-proj-info.el' and `ede-proj-elisp.el' are two interesting examples.

* Menu:

* User interface methods::      Methods associated with keybindings
* Base project methods::        The most basic methods on EDE objects.

File: ede.info,  Node: User interface methods,  Next: Base project methods,  Prev: Extending EDE,  Up: Extending EDE

8.1 User interface methods
==========================

These methods are core behaviors associated with user commands.  If you
do not implement a method, there is a reasonable default that may do
what you need.

`project-add-file'
     Add a file to your project.  Override this if you want to put new
     sources into different fields depending on extension, or other
     details.

`project-remove-file'
     Reverse of project-add-file.

`project-compile-target'
     Override this if you want to do something special when the user
     "compiles" this target.

8.2 Base project methods
========================

These methods are important for querying base information from project
and target types:

`ede-name'
     Return a string that is the name of this target.

`ede-target-name'
     Return a string that is the name of the target used by a Make
     system.

`ede-description'
     A brief description of the project or target.  This is currently
     used by the `ede-speedbar' interface.

`ede-want-file-p'
     Return non-nil if a target will accept a given file.  It is
     generally unecessary to override this.  See the section on source
     code.

`ede-buffer-mine'
     Return non-nil if a buffer belongs to this target.  Used during
     association when a file is loaded.  It is generally unecessary to
     override this unless you keep auxiliary files.

   These methods are used by the semantic package extensions *Note
(semantic)Top::.

`ede-buffer-header-file'
     Return a header file belonging to a given buffer.  Prototypes are
     place there when appropriate

`ede-buffer-documentation-files'
     Return the documentation file information about this file would be
     stored in.

`ede-documentation'
     List all documentation a project or target is responsible for.

8.3 Sourcecode objects
======================

EDE projects track source file / target associates via source code
objects.  The definitions for this is in `ede-source.el'.  A source
code object contains methods that know how to identify a file as being
of that class, (ie, a C file ends with `.c').  Some targets can handle
many different types of sources which must all be compiled together.
For example, a mixed C and C++ program would have instantiations of
both sourcecode types.

   When a target needs to know if it will accept a source file, it
references its list of source code objects.  These objects then make
that decision.

   Source code objects are stored in the target objects as a list of
symbols, where the symbol's value is the object.  This enables the
project save file mechanism to work.

   Here is an example for an instantiation of an Emacs Lisp source code
object:

     (defvar ede-source-emacs
       (ede-sourcecode "ede-emacs-source"
     		  :name "Emacs Lisp"
     		  :sourcepattern "\\.el$"
     		  :garbagepattern '("*.elc"))
       "Emacs Lisp source code definition.")

   If you want to recycle parts of an existing sourcecode object, you
can clone the original, and then just tweak the parts that are
different.  For example:

     (defvar ede-source-emacs-autoload
       (clone ede-source-emacs "ede-source-emacs-autoload"
              :name "Emacs Lisp Autoload"
              :sourcepattern "-loaddefs\\.el")
       "Emacs Lisp autoload source code.")

   In this case, the garbage pattern is the same.

   *Note Sourcecode::.


File: ede.info,  Node: Compiler and Linker objects,  Prev: Sourcecode objects,  Up: Extending EDE

8.4 Compiler and Linker objects
===============================

In order for a target to create a `Makefile', it must know how to
compile the sources into the program or desired data file, and possibly
link them together.

   A compiler object instantiation is used to associate a given target
with a given source code type.  Some targets can handle many types of
sources, and thus has many compilers available to it.  Some targets may
have multiple compilers for a given type of source code.

   EDE will examine the actual source files in a target, cross reference
that against the compiler list to come up with the final set of
compilers that will be inserted into the Makefile.

   Compiler instantiations must also insert variables specifying the
compiler it plans to use, in addition to creating Automake settings for
`configure.in' when appropriate.

   Compiler objects are stored in the target objects as a list of
symbols, where the symbols value is the object.  This enables the
project output mechanism to work more efficiently.

   Targets will also have a special "compiler" slot which lets a user
explicitly choose the compiler they want to use.

   Here is an example for texinfo:

     (defvar ede-makeinfo-compiler
       (ede-compiler
        "ede-makeinfo-compiler"
        :name "makeinfo"
        :variables '(("MAKEINFO" . "makeinfo"))
        :commands '("makeinfo -o $ $<")
        :autoconf '(("AC_CHECK_PROG" . "MAKEINFO, makeinfo"))
        :sourcetype '(ede-makeinfo-source)
        )
       "Compile texinfo files into info files.")

   *Note Compilers::.

   When creating compiler instantiations, it may be useful to `clone'
an existing compiler variable.  Cloning allows you to only modify parts
of the original, while keeping the rest of the same.  Modification of
the original will result in the clone also being changed for shared
value slots.

   The second important object is the linker class.  The linker is
similar to the compiler, except several compilers might be used to
create some object files, and only one linker is used to link those
objects together.

   See `ede-proj-obj.el' for examples of the combination.

          List of top level targets in this project.

    `:tool-cache'

          List of tool cache configurations in this project.  This
          allows any tool to create, manage, and persist
          project-specific settings.

    `:include-path'
          Type: `list'
          Default Value: `(quote ("/include" "../include/"))'

          The default locate function expands filenames within a
          project.  If a header file (.h, .hh, etc) name is expanded,
          and the `:locate-fcn' slot is `nil', then the include path is
          checked first, and other directories are ignored.  For very
          large projects, this optimization can save a lot of time.

          Directory names in the path can be relative to the current
          buffer's `default-directory' (not starting with a /).
          Directories that are relative to the project's root should
          start with a /, such as  "/include", meaning the directory
          `include' off the project root directory.

    `:system-include-path'
          Type: `list'
          Default Value: `nil'

          The system include path for files in this project.  C files
          initialized in an ede-cpp-root-project have their semantic
          system include path set to this value.  If this is `nil',
          then the semantic path is not modified.

    `:spp-table'
          Type: `list'
          Default Value: `nil'

          C Preprocessor macros for your files.  Preprocessor symbols
          will be used while parsing your files.  These macros might be
          passed in through the command line compiler, or are critical
          symbols derived from header files.  Providing header files
          macro values through this slot improves accuracy and
          performance.  Use `:spp-files' to use these files directly.

    `:spp-files'
          Type: `list'
          Default Value: `nil'

          C header file with Preprocessor macros for your files.  The
          PreProcessor symbols appearing in these files will be used
          while parsing files in this project.  See
          `semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-map' for more on how this
          works.

    `:header-match-regexp'
          Type: `string'
          Default Value:
          `"\\.\\(h\\(h\\|xx\\|pp\\|\\+\\+\\)?\\|H\\)$\\|\\<\\w+$"'

          Regexp used to identify C/C++ header files.

    `:locate-fcn'
          Type: `(or null function)'
          Default Value: `nil'

          The locate function can be used in place of
          "ede-expand-filename" so you can quickly customize your
          custom target to use specialized local routines instead of
          the EDE routines.  The function symbol must take two
          arguments:   NAME - The name of the file to find.    DIR -
          The directory root for this cpp-root project.

          It should return the fully qualified file name passed in from
          NAME.  If that file does not exist, it should return nil.

12 Compilers
************

The compiler object is designed to associate source code with
compilers.  The target then references the compilers it can use.  When
the makefile is created, this object type knows how to create compile
commands.

12.1 ede-compilation-program
============================

Inheritance Tree:

    `eieio-instance-inheritor'

         `ede-compilation-program'

              Children:
                    *Note ede-compiler::, *Note ede-linker::.



Create a new object with name NAME of class type ede-compilation-program

Slots:

    `:parent-instance'
          Type: `eieio-instance-inheritor-child'

          The parent of this instance.  If a slot of this class is
          reference, and is unbound, then  the parent is checked for a
          value.

    `:name'
          Type: `string'

          Name of this type of compiler.

    `:variables'
          Type: `list'

          Variables needed in the Makefile for this compiler.  An assoc
          list where each element is (VARNAME . VALUE) where VARNAME is
          a string, and VALUE is either a string, or a list of strings.
          For example, GCC would define CC=gcc, and emacs would define
          EMACS=emacs.

    `:sourcetype'
          Type: `list'

          A list of `ede-sourcecode' *Note ede-sourcecode::. objects
          this class will handle.  This is used to match target objects
          with the compilers and linkers they can use, and which files
          this object is interested in.

    `:rules'
          Type: `list'
          Default Value: `nil'

          Auxiliary rules needed for this compiler to run.  For
          example, yacc/lex files need additional chain rules, or
          inferences.

    `:commands'
          Type: `list'

          The commands used to execute this compiler.  The object which
          uses this compiler will place these commands after it's rule
          definition.

    `:autoconf'
          Type: `list'
          Default Value: `nil'

          Autoconf function to call if this type of compiler is used.
          When a project is in Automake mode, this defines the autoconf
          function to call to initialize automake to use this compiler.
          For example, there may be multiple C compilers, but they all
          probably use the same autoconf form.

    `:objectextention'
          Type: `string'

          A string which is the extention used for object files.  For
          example, C code uses .o on unix, and Emacs Lisp uses .elc.



12.1.1 Specialized Methods
--------------------------

 -- Method: ede-proj-flush-autoconf :AFTER this
     Flush the configure file (current buffer) to accomodate THIS.

 -- Method: ede-proj-makefile-insert-rules :AFTER this
     Insert rules needed for THIS compiler object.

 -- Method: ede-proj-makefile-insert-variables :AFTER this
     Insert variables needed by the compiler THIS.

 -- Method: ede-proj-makefile-insert-commands :AFTER this
     Insert the commands needed to use compiler THIS.  The object
     creating makefile rules must call this method for the compiler it
     decides to use after inserting in the rule.

 -- Method: ede-object-sourcecode :AFTER this
     Retrieves the slot `sourcetype' from an object of class
     `ede-compilation-program'

 -- Method: ede-proj-tweak-autoconf :AFTER this
     Tweak the configure file (current buffer) to accomodate THIS.

          A string which is the extention used for object files.  For
          example, C code uses .o on unix, and Emacs Lisp uses .elc.

    `:makedepends'
          Type: `boolean'
          Default Value: `nil'

          Non-`nil' if this compiler can make dependencies.

    `:uselinker'
          Type: `boolean'
          Default Value: `nil'

          Non-`nil' if this compiler creates code that can be linked.
          This requires that the containing target also define a list
          of available linkers that can be used.



12.2.1 Specialized Methods
--------------------------

 -- Method: ede-proj-makefile-insert-object-variables :AFTER this
          targetname sourcefiles
     Insert an OBJ variable to specify object code to be generated for
     THIS.  The name of the target is TARGETNAME as a string.
     SOURCEFILES is the list of files to be objectified.  Not all
     compilers do this.

 -- Method: ede-compiler-intermediate-objects-p :AFTER this
     Return non-`nil' if THIS has intermediate object files.  If this
     compiler creates code that can be linked together, then the object
     files created by the compiler are considered intermediate.

 -- Method: ede-compiler-intermediate-object-variable :AFTER this
          targetname
     Return a string based on THIS representing a make object variable.
     TARGETNAME is the name of the target that these objects belong to.
