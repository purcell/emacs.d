CEDET Manual
************

CEDET is a Collection of Emacs Development Environment Tools including
core libraries such as EIEIO, and semantic, and user interface tools
such as Speedbar, EDE, and COGRE.

   While these tools are independent, and all have their own manuals,
they are also all co-dependent within CEDET, and are dependent on the
CEDET common libraries such as inversion and ezimage.

   This manual describes how to configure the tools as a whole to
accomplish some tasks.

   To send bug reports, or participate in discussions about CEDET, use

1 Overview
**********

The CEDET collection is made up of several tools.  Each tool has it's
own manual with details for that tool.

   At the core of the CEDET suite is EIEIO, which is an Implementation
of Emacs Interpreted Objects.  This provides a CLOS like interface to
writing object-oriented code in Emacs.  EIEIO forms the base of most of
the other tools, with the notable exception of Speedbar.

   Several other tools form the next layer of CEDET functionality.  For
project management, EDE provides a simple way to create projects.  You
can create an EDE centric project, which uses either Makefiles, or
AutoMakefiles, or it can wrap an automake based program you've already
developed.  You can also create simple EDE wrappers on top of any style
of project.  EDE provides a backgrop for any other CEDET tool that
needs to know the filesystem scope of a code base, where include
directories might be.

   semantic provides another mid-level layer.  semantic provides a set
of tools for developing parsers for different languages, and an API for
searching and manipulating tags generated from your source code.
semantic also provides a wide range of core tag centric utilities such
as enhanced tag decoration, code analysis, and the coveted "Smart
Completion" feature.

   Another mid-level tool is SRecode or the Semantic Recoder.  SRecode
is a template management system designed with the goal of providing a
way to build code-generating applications that are easily modified or
extended by users.  At it's core is a template authoring and insertion
system.  A minor mode provides a simple way to insert templates from
the various template libraries.

   Speedbar is a user interface tool that provides a narrow view into
your filesystem and tags.  Speedbar is also an API for designing other
tools and is used for displaying EDE project information, Semantic
smart completion options, Email, Info, and even GDB stack information.

   Lastly, COGRE is a COnnected GRaph Editor.  The core is an object
design and library for drawing, saving, and restoring simple connected
graphs.  Built on this is a UML based tool which interfaces with
Semantic Tag information to draw simple UML diagrams of your code.  As
of this writing COGRE is quite simple.  Longer term plans include using
COGRE as a way of manipulating source code indirectly.

   All these tools depend on a suite of simple library functions, such
as inversion, ezimage, pretty printing, and mode-local variables.

1.1 EIEIO
=========

EIEIO contains the core object library for CEDET.  You can define
classes, and methods for those classes using CLOS style syntax.
Objects can be customized using the Emacs customization tool, which
allows easy creation of dialog box style UIs.  A series of bases
classes allows the creation of Emacs centric tools, wrapping up the
details of persistence, instance tracking, or instance inheritance.

   EIEIO also includes several stray tools, such as `tree.el' for
drawing tree diagrams, `chart.el' for drawing charts, `linemark.el' for
managing visible bookmarks programatically, and `lmcompile.el', which
is a linemark tool that puts out bookmarks for compiler error hits.

   Lastly, EIEIO has baseclasses for writing Speedbar interfaces.  Take
an existing object hierarchy and inherit from these baseclasses to be
browsable in Speedbar.

   For more details on EIEIO, read the *note EIEIO Reference Manul:
(eieio)top.

1.2 Semantic
============

semantic is a parser generator, lexical analyzer, parser development
environment, parser, tag generation and management system.  Build on
this is a persistent tag management system database and search utility.
Code analysis and completion generation is also provided.  semantic
includes tools such as speedbar interfaces to tags, context analysis,
and completion options, Popup smart completion, tag decoration, and
support for a wide range of Emacs tools such as Imenu, wich-func,
hippie-expand, isearch, and cut/copy/paste.

   For high level overviews, configuration advice, etc, please read

1.3 SRecode
===========

SRecode is a Template manager for writing code from Semantic templates.
It includes a specialized template authoring language and environment,
template loader and interpreter.  A minor mode for inserting mode
specific templates, and some sample applications that also uses
templates to write code.

   For more details on SRecode, read the *note SRecode Manual:
(srecode)top;


File: cedet.info,  Node: Speedbar,  Next: EDE,  Prev: SRecode,  Up: Overview

1.4 Speedbar
============

Speedbar is an abbreviated everything browser.  If you can
conceptualize browsable information into 20 columns, then Speedbar can
display it for you.

   Speedbar comes with several interfaces, with the primary one being
for files and tags.  It can also display buffer lists, RMAIL boxes, and
Info nodes.  Combined with CEDET, it also provides project tracking,
smart completion lists, Class browsing, Connected graph browsing.

   You can use speedbar to write your own browsers.  Some external tools
include ERC (Irc client), xslt-process, MH-E (mail reader), and ECB, a
code browser which embeds Speebar.

   Speedbar has been a part of Emacs for quite a while.  The CEDET
version of speedbar (as of this writing, Jul 08) is nearly identical to
the version in Emacs 22.

   For more details, read the *note Speedbar Manual: (speedbar)top.


File: cedet.info,  Node: EDE,  Next: COGRE,  Prev: Speedbar,  Up: Overview

1.5 EDE
=======

EDE is the Emacs Development Environment, which means that it manages
projects, and can build Makefiles, track distribution and web sites
associated with your GNU project.

   EDE has several types of projects it can manage with varying degrees
of development support.  An EDE centric project will generate Makefiles
or Automake files, and provides menus and keybindings for compiling any
target, debugging programs by providing the arguments to your debugger,
and will make sure you don't forget to include some file in your
targets.  It will help you build distribution files, and post them to
the web (such as with Source Forge).  EDE will track revision numbers
and make sure they are updated in multiple places.

   Projects that are merely wrapped with EDE can support a small subset
of the above.  All project provide an API to other programs that need
to know the scope of a project, such as which files belong together,
where include directories might be, how to find documentation, and
details of that nature.  You can even create project-local variables,
which are Emacs variables with specific values within the scope of an
EDE controlled project.

   Read more about it in the *note EDE reference manual: (ede)top.


File: cedet.info,  Node: COGRE,  Next: Other Library Functions,  Prev: EDE,  Up: Overview

1.6 COGRE
=========

COGRE is a COnnected GRaph Editor.  You can use it to create simple
connected graphs and diagrams.  You can also create more complex UML
class diagrams in it, or even bind UML diagrams directly to source
code, navigating your source via the UML diagram.

   While COGRE does have a lot of functionality, it still needs more
work.  Consider improving COGRE.

   Read more a bout it in *note the COGRE manual: (cogre)top.


File: cedet.info,  Node: Other Library Functions,  Prev: COGRE,  Up: Overview

1.7 Other CEDET Library functions
=================================

CEDET provides several other useful libraries in the `common/'
directory.  These libraries supply most of their documentation through
the Commentary section of the Emacs Lisp file.

   Some of the libraries are:

   `' cedet-edebug.el Collection of extensions to support custom CEDET
     datatypes.

   `' ezimage.el Support for covering text in an Emacs buffer with an
     image.  This is based on text patterns, and is portable across
     most versions of Emacs and XEmacs.

     Using ezimage allows you to write a text based UI, and then
     enhance it with images afterwards, allowing your UI to work well
     in a text frame, in addition to looking pretty spiff in a
     graphical frame.

   `' pulse.el Simple way to briefly highlight a region or line.  For
     Emacs 22, it will pulse the line, with the color drifting from one
     shade to another.  For older versions Emacs, it will just
     highlight the line briefly.

   `' fame.el Support for `message' channels, allowing a program to
     provide a wide range of messages, and allowing a user to configure
     which set they want to see.

   `' inversion.el Revision management system.  Allows you to use
     `require' syntax for a specific version of some tool.  If the tool
     is not compatible with your desired version, a signal is thrown.

   `' mode-local.el Specify functions that have different behaviors
     based on major-mode, or variables with different local values
     based on major mode.  Setting a value to a specific mode causes
     the value to change for all buffers of that mode.

     mode-local is also aware of mode inheritance, such that C++ mode
     inherits some C configurations.  You can also run code, or access
     variables from other modes by with a temorary scoped setting.

     mode local is used extensively throughout the semantic package.

   `' pprint.el A pretty printer for Emacs Lisp code.  Use it to dump
     out large complex datastructures.

   `' sformat.el A Super Format function.  Define lists of associations
     between letters and values, and then create format strings with %
     tokens for any letter.

     sformat is used in the semantic document package to construct
     complex documentation strings.

   `' working.el Display a working message, or a "percentage done"
     style bar in the mini-buffer.  Tasks that take a long time can use
     working to provide user feedback explaining a delay.

2 Installation and Basic Configuration
**************************************

A compilation centric version of the CEDET installation is in the
INSTALL file in the top level CEDET directory.

  1. Compile CEDET

          make

     or

          make EMACS=<your favorite emacs> MAKEINFO=<substitute, or echo>

     If you do not have `make' installed on your system, or if you
     cannot get the `Makefile's to work, then you can use the all Emacs
     solution in `cedet-build.el' which is found in the toplevel CEDET

     Read the Commentary section of `cedet-build.el' for details on
     using this method.

  2. Install .emacs hooks

     Load CEDET in your `.emacs' file.  You do not need to install all
     of cedet into any magic Emacs controlled directories, or modify
     your loadpath.  The CEDET bootstrap file will automatically update
     your load path, and load all the autoload files.  The cedet
     configuration will load a minimum set of files in.

          ;; Load CEDET
          (load-file "~/cedet-VERSION/common/cedet.el")

  3. Configuration

     You will likely need to configure CEDET to your application.  Visit
     the other chapters in this manual for samples to get some ideas on
     possible configuration scenarios.

  4. Contribute to CEDET

     For general discussions on development of these tools, use the
     mailing list cedet-devel@sourceforge.net via the URL:

     `http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/cedet-devel'

     For semantic development use the mailing list cedet-semantic.net
     via the URL:

     `http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/cedet-semantic'

     For EIEIO use the mailing list cedet-eieio@sourceforge.net via the
     URL:

     `http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/cedet-eieio'

  5. Install Additional Tools

     You may also need to download some of the following files for more
     obscure features.

     To use the JavaScript parser: javascript-mode.el :
     `http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/JavaScriptMode'

     To use Exuberent ctags to emable Semantic support in more major
     modes, or as an extra database backend parser, install ctags:
     `http://ctags.sourceforge.net/'

     To use the UML chart generation from `M-x semantic-dot' graphviz
     dot programs, including `dotty' `http://www.graphviz.org/'

     To use the graphviz dot parser: `graphviz-dot-mode.el' see the
     commentary in cogre/wisent-dot.el

3 JDEE Target
*************

JDEE, or the Java Development Environment, depends on CEDET for both
EIEIO, the object system, and Semantic, for parsing and providing
tagging information.

   In addition to the basic CEDET configuration, you will likely want to
add the following Semantic configuration to your `.emacs' file.

     (semantic-load-enable-minimum-features)

   This provides basic idle-time parsing of files, and persistence to
support the semantic APIs.

   If you would like to use more of the Semantic tools for your coding
in Java, you may want to enable this instead:

     (semantic-load-enable-code-helpers)

   or the fancier

     (semantic-load-enable-guady-code-helpers)

   See the *note Semantic Configuration: (semantic)Canned Configuration.
section of the semantic manual for more details about these features.


File: cedet.info,  Node: ECB Target,  Next: Project Management,  Prev: JDEE Target,  Up: Top

4 ECB Target
************

ECB, or the Emacs Code Browser depends on CEDET for the semantic
parsing engine, and several other features.  ECB can display a window
that shows semantic tag information.

   ECB can also be used with JDEE.

   In addition to the basic CEDET configuration, you will likely want to
add the following Semantic configuration to your `.emacs' file.

     (semantic-load-enable-code-helpers)

   or the fancier

     (semantic-load-enable-guady-code-helpers)

   See the *note Semantic Configuration: (semantic)Canned Configuration.
section of the semantic manual for more details about these features.


File: cedet.info,  Node: Project Management,  Next: Code Completion,  Prev: ECB Target,  Up: Top

5 Project Management
********************

If you are looking for CEDET to help you manage a project full of
sourcecode, then you will be using EDE and semantic.

   To enable EDE add this to your `.emacs' file after CEDET is loaded:

     (global-ede-mode 1)

   You can use EDE to define your projects.  If you are starting a new
project, put a file from your new project into a buffer, and type:

     M-x ede-new RET

   Now select either "Make" or "Automake", which determines the
underlying build technology to use for compilation.

   Use the menu to add targets.  You can then use either Speedbar or
dired to populate your targets with files.

   For more details, see the *note EDE reference manual: (ede)Top.

   In addition to EDE and basic CEDET configuration, you will likely
want to add the following semantic configuration to your `.emacs' file.

     (semantic-load-enable-code-helpers)

   See the *note Semantic Configuration: (semantic)Canned Configuration.
section of the semantic manual for more details about these features.

   You may also want to enable the SRecode template insertion mode.

     (srecode-minor-mode 1)

   Both semantic and SRecode take advantage of EDE's knowledge of a
projects structure.


File: cedet.info,  Node: Code Completion,  Next: Code Generation,  Prev: Project Management,  Up: Top

6 Code Completion
*****************

Code Completion, or perhaps "Intellisense" is a difficult problem to
get working in Emacs.  To use the CEDET suite to do it, you will need
to start by augmenting the basic CEDET install in your `.emacs' file
with:

     (semantic-load-enable-code-helpers)

   Basic code helpers enable idle parsing and summary mode.  To get
idle-completions mode, and some more decorative features, use:

     (semantic-load-enable-guady-code-helpers)

   TODO - add other handy bindings here.

   For more on configuration *note Semantic Configuration:
(semantic)Canned Configuration.  section of the semantic manual for
more details about these features.

   The basic idea is that Semantic will need to parse your source code
and build lookup tables.  The tables are then searched to provide the
completion you might be looking for.

   To improve the things Semantic can find and complete with, you then
need to configure a few more things.  This is done mainly by providing
details on where Semantic can find the source code where your tag
definitions are.

   For more, *note Semantic search configuration:
(semantic-user)Semanticdb Search Configuration.

   Once you've optimized semantic's ability to find your sources, there
are several code completion options.  For more, *note semantic
analyzer: (semantic-user)Analyzer.

   If code completion doesn't work on your code right away, please read
the section on *note Smart Completion Debugging: (semantic-user)Smart
Completion Debugging.

7 Code Generation
*****************

Code Generation, or the ability to automatically write code from some
set of static data is done through the SRecode library.  SRecode is a
template manager that uses the semantic infrastructure to support
common concepts across multiple languages.

   To effectively create a code-generation library, you need to
configure semantic.  Read *note Semantic Configuration:
(semantic)Canned Configuration.  for more.

   Secondly, you will need to configure SRecode.  Read *note SRecode
Manual: (srecode)Quick Start;

   Once installed, you can jump right in to writing your Lisp and *note
Template Writing: (screcode)Template Writing.


File: cedet.info,  Node: C++ Features,  Next: GNU Global,  Prev: Code Generation,  Up: Top

8 C++ Features
**************

If you are using CEDET With C++, then there are a few C++ specific
options you may need to update.

8.1 C Pre-processor
===================

C and C++ use pre-processor directives, and the semantic parser has
some basic support for a pre-processor.  As such, you may need to set
up some macros.  You can do that in two ways.

   The first option is to create your own symbol map in Emacs Lisp.  You
can customize the preprocessor symbol map.

 -- Variable: semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-map
     Table of C Preprocessor keywords used by the Semantic C lexer.
     Each entry is a cons cell like this:   ( "KEYWORD" . "REPLACEMENT"
     ) Where KEYWORD is the macro that gets replaced in the lexical
     phase, and REPLACEMENT is a string that is inserted in it's place.
     Empty string implies that the lexical analyzer will discard
     KEYWORD when it is encountered.

     Alternately, it can be of the form:   ( "KEYWORD" ( LEXSYM1 "str"
     1 1 ) ... ( LEXSYMN "str" 1 1 ) ) where LEXSYM is a symbol that
     would normally be produced by the lexical analyzer, such as
     `symbol' or "string".  The string in the second position is the
     text that makes up the replacement.  This is the way to have
     multiple lexical symbols in a replacement.  Using the first way to
     specify text like "foo::bar" would not work, because : is a
     separate lexical symbol.

     A quick way to see what you would need to insert is to place a
     definition such as:

     #define MYSYM foo::bar

     into a C file, and do this:   `M-x' semantic-lex-spp-describe

     The output table will describe the symbols needed.

   Alternately, you can use an existing C header file, or write your own
custom C header file, and use the macros in that to initialize the
preprocessor list.

 -- Variable: semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-file
     List of C/C++ files that contain preprocessor macros for the C
     lexer.  Each entry is a filename and each file is parsed, and
     those macros are included in every C/C++ file parsed by semantic.
     You can use this variable instead of
     `semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-map' to store your global
     macros in a more natural way.

   Some such symbols for `stdio.h' as found on Linux are defined in
`semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-map-builtin'.

   Lastly, you could just opt to ignore conditional parsing.

 -- Option: semantic-c-obey-conditional-section-parsing-flag
     Non-`nil' means to interpret preprocessor #if sections.  This
     implies that some blocks of code will not be parsed based on the
     values of the conditions in the #if blocks.

8.2 System Include path
=======================

If you want the code-completion to work with C++ system header file,
you will need to update `semantic-dependency-system-include-path' for
C++ mode.

     M-x customize-variable RET semantic-c-dependency-system-include-path RET

   Customizing this variable will allow you to setup your system
include path and will update all files when you use custom to do it.

8.3 EDE Setup
=============

For large C++ programs, it is important to setup EDE for it.  While EDE
can be used to create makefiles and such using Automake, EDE also
provides a way to merely describe a project so that tools like semantic
can find your sources.  For C++, you may want to do this:

     (global-ede-mode 1) ;; Enable EDE
     (ede-cpp-root-project "SOMENAME" :file "/dir/to/some/file")

   where SOMENAME is a name for this project, and the file is a file
name that exists at the root of your project directory.  There are many
more options for the optimization of finding your header files.  For
more on this option, including include path setting, and providing
macro to the C pre-processor, see *note ede-cpp-root: (ede)the
ede-cpp-root chapter.


File: cedet.info,  Node: GNU Global,  Next: ID Utils,  Prev: C++ Features,  Up: Top

9 GNU Global
************

Several tools in CEDET can support the use of GNU Global.  If you use
GNU Global in your project, you should enable the use of it to enhance
or speed up various tools in CEDET.

   You can download GNU Global from `http://www.gnu.org/software/global'

   To make sure your GNU Global installation is good, use the command

     M-x cedet-gnu-global-version-check RET

   You can wrap any CEDET / GNU Global configurations in your `.emacs'
file like this:

     (setq cedet-global-command "global") ; Change to path of global as needed
     (when (cedet-gnu-global-version-check t)  ; Is it ok?
         ;; Configurations for GNU Global and CEDET
         )

9.1 EDE and GNU Global
======================

The EDE project system can use GNU Global to accelerate finding files
within a project.  The EDE command to `ede-find-file' bound to `C-c .
f' is one direct application.  semantic also makes heavy use of of the
feature to find header files.

   To enable it, configure the variable `ede-locate-setup-options'.
Something like this can work in your `.emacs' file.

     (setq ede-locate-setup-options
           '(ede-locate-global
             ede-locate-base))

9.2 semantic Database
=====================

semantic can use GNU Global as a back end for database searches.  To
enable it, use:

     (semanticdb-enable-gnu-global-databases 'c++-mode)

   where the first argument is a `major-mode' in which to use it.

   GNU Global will then be used for project-wide searches as a backup
when pre-existing semantic database searches may not have parsed all
your files.

9.3 semantic
============

The semantic symref tool can use GNU Global to local symbol references.
This tool will automatically detect GNU Global and use it.  You can
search for references via the commands:

`semantic-symref'
     Find references to the tag under the cursor.

`semantic-symref-symbol'
     Find references to an arbitrary symbol.

10 ID Utils
***********

Several tools in CEDET can support the use of ID Utils.  If you use ID
Utils in your project, you should enable the use of it to enhance or
speed up various tools in CEDET.

   You can download ID Utils from `http://www.gnu.org/software/idutils/'

   To make sure your ID Utils installation is good, use the command

     M-x cedet-idutils-version-check RET

   You can wrap any CEDET / ID Utils configurations in your `.emacs'
file like this:

     (when (cedet-idutils-version-check t)  ; Is it ok?
         ;; Configurations for ID Utils and CEDET.
         )

10.1 EDE and ID Utils
=====================

The EDE project system can use ID Utils to accelerate finding files
within a project.  The EDE command to `ede-find-file' bound to `C-c .
f' is one direct application.  semantic also makes heavy use of of the
feature to find header files.

   To enable it, configure the variable `ede-locate-setup-options'.
Something like this can work in your `.emacs' file.

     (setq ede-locate-setup-options
           '(ede-locate-idutils
             ede-locate-base))

10.2 semantic
=============

The semantic symref tool can use ID Utils to local symbol references.
This tool will automatically detect ID Utils and use it.  You can
search for references via the commands:

`semantic-symref'
     Find references to the tag under the cursor.

`semantic-symref-symbol'
     Find references to an arbitrary symbol.

11 CScope
*********

Several tools in CEDET can support the use of CScope.  If you use
CScope in your project, you can enable the use of it to enhance or
speed up various tools in CEDET.

   You can download CScope from `http://cscope.sourceforge.net/'

   To make sure your CScope installation is good, use the command

     M-x cedet-cscope-version-check RET

   You can wrap any CEDET / CScope configurations in your `.emacs' file
like this:

     (when (cedet-cscope-version-check t)  ; Is it ok?
         ;; Configurations for CScope and CEDET.
         )

11.1 Detecting CScope
=====================

CScope is detected by the presense of a `cscope.out' file at the ROOT
of your current project, as specified by EDE.  CScope the program
supports multiple `cscope.out' files spread out through your project,
but this is not detecte by CEDET.  It will also use a `cscope.out' in
the same directory as your sources if you do not use EDE

   If you use CScope and need this feature, please consider fixing it.
Contact the cedet-devel mailing list.

11.2 EDE and CScope
===================

The EDE project system can use CScope to accelerate finding files
within a project.  The EDE command to `ede-find-file' bound to `C-c .
f' is one direct application.  semantic also makes heavy use of of the
feature to find header files for C and C++.

   To enable it, configure the variable `ede-locate-setup-options'.
Something like this can work in your `.emacs' file.

     (setq ede-locate-setup-options
           '(ede-locate-cscope
             ede-locate-base))

11.3 semantic Database
======================

@TODO

   semantic can could use CScope as a back end for database searches,
but this has not been implemented yet.

11.4 semantic
=============

The semantic symref tool can use CScope to local symbol references.
This tool will automatically detect CScope and use it.  You can search
for references via the commands:

`semantic-symref'
     Find references to the tag under the cursor.

`semantic-symref-symbol'
     Find references to an arbitrary symbol.

12 Maintenance
**************

Most of the CEDET tools do their best to maintain their data files and
caches.  It is useful, however, to periodically run:

     M-x semanticdb-cleanup-cache-files RET

   to delete old database cache files that may no longer be associated
with directories on your system.

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                        Version 1.1, March 2000

     Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
     the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
     modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
     this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
     credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
     modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.


  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
     under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to
     any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee,
     and is addressed as "you".

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
     section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
     relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
     Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
     nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
     (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
     mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
     The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
     the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
     philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly
     and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed
     to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
     Transparent.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
     Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
     or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than
     100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you
     must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,
     all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
     computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
     of the Document, free of added material, which the general
     network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
     charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

     A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
     distinct    from that of the Document, and from those of previous
     versions    (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
     History section    of the Document).  You may use the same title
     as a previous version    if the original publisher of that version
     gives permission.
     B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
     entities    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
     Modified    Version, together with at least five of the principal
     authors of the    Document (all of its principal authors, if it
     has less than five).
     C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
     Modified Version, as the publisher.
     D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
     E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
     adjacent to the other copyright notices.
     F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
     notice    giving the public permission to use the Modified Version
     under the    terms of this License, in the form shown in the
     Addendum below.
     G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
     Sections    and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
     license notice.
     H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
     I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add
     to    it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
       publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.
     If    there is no section entitled "History" in the Document,
     create one    stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of
     the Document as    given on its Title Page, then add an item
     describing the Modified    Version as stated in the previous
     sentence.
     J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
     likewise    the network locations given in the Document for
     previous versions    it was based on.  These may be placed in the
     "History" section.     You may omit a network location for a work
     that was published at    least four years before the Document
     itself, or if the original    publisher of the version it refers
     to gives permission.
     K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
     preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
      substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
     and/or dedications given therein.
     L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
     unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
     or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
     M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
     may not be included in the Modified Version.
     N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"    or to
     conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties-for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition
     of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
     Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
     copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
     called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
     other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
     account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
     derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
     quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
     placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
     aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
     aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License provided that you also include the
     original English version of this License.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original English
     version of this License, the original English version will prevail.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:


       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
       Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant
Sections" instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover
Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
