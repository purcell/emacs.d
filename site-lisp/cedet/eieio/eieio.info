Enhanced Implementation of Emacs Interpreted Objects
****************************************************

EIEIO is a framework for writing object oriented applications in emacs
Lisp, and is a result of my taking various object oriented classes at
work and my attempt to understand some of it better by implementing it.
The real reason I started EIEIO is because someone in one of my classes
said "I bet emacs can't do that!".  Well then, I just had to prove them
wrong!

1 Quick Start
*************

EIEIO provides an Object Oriented layer for Emacs Lisp.  You can use
EIEIO to create classes, methods for those classes, and instances of
classes.

   To start, create a class:

     (defclass record () ; No superclasses
       ((name :initarg :name
              :initform ""
              :type string
              :custom string
              :documentation "The name of a person.")
        (birthday :initarg :birthday
                  :initform "Jan 1, 1970"
                  :custom string
                  :type string
                  :documentation "The person's birthday.")
        (phone :initarg :phone
               :initform ""
               :documentation "Phone number."))
       "A single record for tracking people I know.")

   In this example, the class `record' is declared with three slots,
which are `name', `birthday', and `phone'.

   You can create methods against your classes.  A simple method may
look like this:

     (defmethod call-record ((rec record) &optional scriptname)
       "Dial the phone for the record REC.
     Execute the program SCRIPTNAME as to dial the phone."
       (message "Dialing the phone for %s"  (oref rec name))
       (shell-command (concat (or scriptname "dialphone.sh")
                              " "
                              (oref rec phone))))

   In this example, the first argument to `call-record' is a list.  The
list is of the form (VARNAME CLASSNAME).

   VARNAME is the name of the variable used for the first argument.
CLASSNAME is the name of the class that is expected as the first
argument for this method.

   EIEIO dispatches methods based on the type of the first argument.
You can have multiple methods with the same name for different classes
of object.  When the `call-record' method is called, the first argument
is examined to determine the class of that argument, and the method
matching the input type is then executed.

   Once the behavior of a class is defined, you can create a new object
of type `record'.  Objects are created by calling the constructor.  The
constructor is a function with the same name as your class which
returns a new instance of that class. It might look like this:

     (setq rec (record "Eric" :name "Eric" :birthday "June" :phone "555-5555"))

   The first argument is the name given to this instance.  Each instance
is given a name so different instances can be easily distinguished
during debugging.

   It can be a bit repetitive to also have a :name slot.  A handy
baseclass to use in this case is `eieio-named'.  *Note eieio-named::.

   Calling methods on an object is a lot like calling any function.  The
first argument should be an object of a class which has had this method
defined for it.  In this example it would look like this:

     (call-record rec)

   or

     (call-record rec "my-call-script")

   In these examples, the method `call-record' is called.  EIEIO
examines the class of `rec' and method defined above will be called.
If `rec' is some other class, or a number, or other datatype, then it
will signal `no-method-definition'. *Note Signals::.

2 Introduction
**************

EIEIO is a CLOS (Common Lisp Object System) compatibility layer.  Due
to restrictions in the Emacs Lisp language, CLOS cannot be completely
supported, and a few functions have been added in place of setf.

2.1 What EIEIO supports
=======================

  1. A structured framework for the creation of basic classes with
     attributes and methods using singular inheritance similar to CLOS.

  2. Type checking, and slot unbinding.

  3. Method definitions similar to CLOS.

  4. Simple and complex class browsers.

  5. Edebug support for methods.

  6. Imenu updates.

  7. Byte compilation support of methods.

  8. Help system extensions for classes and methods.

  9. Automatic texinfo documentation generator.

 10. Several base classes for interesting tasks.

 11. Simple test suite.

 12. Public and private classifications for slots (extensions to CLOS)

 13. Customization support in a class (extension to CLOS)

2.2 Issues using EIEIO
======================

Complete `defclass' tag support
     All CLOS tags are currently supported, but the following are not
     currently implemented correctly:

    `:metaclass'
          There is only one base superclass for all EIEIO classes,
          which is the `eieio-default-superclass'.

    `:default-initargs'
          Each slot has an `:initarg' tag, so this is not really
          necessary.

Mock object initializers
     Each class contains a mock object used for fast initialization of
     instantiated objects.  Using functions with side effects on object
     slot values can potentially cause modifications in the mock
     object.  EIEIO should use a deep copy but currently does not.

`:around' method tag
     This CLOS method tag is non-functional.

3 Building Classes
******************

A class is a definition for organizing data and methods together.  In
EIEIO a class has similar structure to that found in other OO languages.

   Create a new class `defclass'.

 -- Function: defclass class-name superclass-list slot-list
          options-or-doc
     This function is specified by CLOS, and EIEIO conforms in
     structure.

     Creates a new class called CLASS-NAME.  In Emacs, the class is
     represented as a self-referential symbol with the name CLASS-NAME.
     The structure of the class is stored on the CLASS-NAME symbol as
     a property.

     The CLASS-NAME symbol's variable documentation string is a
     modified version of the doc string found in OPTIONS-OR-DOC.  Each
     time a method is defined the symbol's documentation string is
     updated to include the methods documentation as well.

     The parent classes for CLASS-NAME is SUPERCLASS-LIST.  Each
     element of SUPERCLASS-LIST must be a class.  These classes are the
     parents of the class being created.  Every slot that appears in
     each parent class is replicated in the new class.

     If two parents share the same slot name, the parent which appears
     in the SUPERCLASS-LIST first sets the tags for that slot.  If a
     slot in the new class' slot list matches a parent, then the new
     specifications for the child class override that of the parent.

     Whenever defclass is used to create a new class, two predicates are
     created for it.  The predicate names are `CLASS-NAME-p' and
     `CLASS-NAME-child-p'

      -- Function: CLASS-NAME-p object
          Return `t' if OBJECT is of the class CLASS-NAME.

      -- Function: CLASS-NAME-child-p object
          Return `t' if OBJECT is of the class CLASS-NAME, or is of a
          subclass of CLASS-NAME.


 -- Variable: eieio-error-unsupported-class-tags
     If Non-nil, then `defclass' will signal an error if a tag in a
     slot specifier is unsupported.

     This option is here to support programs written with older
     versions of EIEIO when such errors were not produced.

File: eieio.info,  Node: Inheritance,  Next: Slot Options,  Up: Building Classes

3.1 Inheritance
===============

A basic feature of an object oriented language is inheritance.  In
EIEIO, a defined class specifies the super classes it inherites from
with the second argument to defclass.

   For example, a parent class might be:

     (defclass my-baseclass ()
        ((slot-A :initarg :slot-A)
         (slot-B :initarg :slot-B))
       "My Baseclass.")

   To subclass from `my-baseclass', you would specify it in the
superclass list.

     (defclass my-subclass (my-baseclass)
        ((specific-slot-A :initarg specific-slot-A)
         )
        "My subclass of my-baseclass")

   Instances of `my-subclass' will inherit `slot-A' and `slot-B', in
addition to having `specific-slot-A' from the declaration of
`my-subclass'.

   EIEIO also supports multiple inheritance.  If there was a second
baseclass, or perhaps an interface style class, it could be declared
like this:

     (defclass my-interface ()
        ((interface-slot :initarg :interface-slot))
        "An interface to special behavior."
        :abstract t)

   The interface class defines a special `interface-slot', and also
specifies itself as abstract.  Abstract classes cannot be instantiated.
It is not required to make interfaces abstract, but it is a good idea.

   To use a baseclass, and the interface, the subclass declaration would
now look like this:

     (defclass my-subclass (my-baseclass my-interface)
        ((specific-slot-A :initarg specific-slot-A)
         )
        "My subclass of my-baseclass")

   Now `my-subclass' has also has `interface-slot'.

   If `my-baseclass' and `my-interface' had slots with the same name,
then the superclass showing up in the list first will define the slot
attributes.

   Inheritance in EIEIO is more than just combining different slots.
It is also important in method invocation.  *Note Methods::.

   If a method is called on an instance of `my-subclass', and that
method only has an implementation on `my-baseclass', or perhaps
`my-interface', then the implementation for the baseclass is called.

   If there is a method implementation for `my-subclass', and another
in `my-baseclass', the implementation for `my-subclass' can call up to
the superclass as well.


File: eieio.info,  Node: Slot Options,  Next: Class Options,  Prev: Inheritance,  Up: Building Classes

3.2 Slot Options
================

SLOT-LIST is a list of elements where each element defines one slot.
Each slot is a list of the form:

       (SLOT-NAME :TAG1 ATTRIB-VALUE1
                  :TAG2 ATTRIB-VALUE2
                  :TAGN ATTRIB-VALUEN)

   where SLOT-NAME is a symbol that will be used to refer to the slot.
:TAG is a symbol that describes a feature to be set on the slot.
ATTRIB-VALUE is a lisp expression that will be used for :TAG.

   Valid tags are:

`:initarg'
     The `:initarg' specifier gives this slot a name that can be used
     in the argument list of the constructor to specify a value for the
     new instance being created.

     A good symbol to use for initarg is one that starts with a colon
     `:'.

     The slot specified like this:
            (myslot :initarg :myslot)
     could then be initialized to the number 1 like this:
            (myobject "name" :myslot 1)

     *Note Making New Objects::.

`:initform'
     A expression used as the default value for this slot.

     If `:initform' is left out, that slot defaults to being unbound.
     It is an error to reference an unbound slot, so if you need slots
     to always be in a bound state, you should always use an
     `:initform' specifier.

     Use `slot-boundp' to test if a slot is unbound *Note Predicates::.
     Use `slot-makeunbound' to set a slot to being unbound after giving
     it a value *Note Accessing Slots::.

     The value passed to initform is automatically quoted.  Thus,
          :initform (1 2 3)
     appears as the specified list in the default object.  A symbol
     that is a function like this:
          :initform +
     will set the initial value as that symbol.  A function that is a
     lambda expression, like this:
          :initform (lambda () some-variablename)

     will be evaluated at instantiation time to the value of
     `some-variablename'.

     Lastly, using the function `lambda-default' instead of `lambda'
     will let you specify a lambda expression to use as the value,
     without evaluation, thus:
          :initform (lambda-default () some-variablename)
     @TODO - This will be deleted after fair warning.

     will not be evaluated at instantiation time, and the value in this
     slot will instead be `(lambda () some-variablename)'.

     After a class has been created with `defclass', you can change
     that default value with `oset-default'. *Note Accessing Slots::.

`:type'
     An unquoted type specifier used to validate data set into this
     slot.  *Note (cl)Type Predicates::.  Here are some examples:
    `symbol'
          A symbol.

    `number'
          A number type

    `my-class-name'
          An object of your class type.

    `(or null symbol)'
          A symbol, or nil.

    `function'
          A function symbol, or a `lambda-default' expression.


`:allocation'
     Either :class or :instance (defaults to :instance) used to specify
     how data is stored.  Slots stored per instance have unique values
     for each object.  Slots stored per class have shared values for
     each object.  If one object changes a :class allocated slot, then
     all objects for that class gain the new value.

`:documentation'
     Documentation detailing the use of this slot.  This documentation
     is exposed when the user describes a class, and during
     customization of an object.

`:accessor'
     Name of a generic function which can be used to fetch the value of
     this slot.  You can call this function later on your object and
     retrieve the value of the slot.

     This options is in the CLOS spec, but is not fully compliant in
     EIEIO.

`:writer'
     Name of a generic function which will write this slot.

     This options is in the CLOS spec, but is not fully compliant in
     EIEIO.

`:reader'
     Name of a generic function which will read this slot.

     This options is in the CLOS spec, but is not fully compliant in
     EIEIO.

`:custom'
     A custom :type specifier used when editing an object of this type.
     See documentation for `defcustom' for details.  This specifier is
     equivalent to the :type spec of a `defcustom' call.

     This options is specific to Emacs, and is not in the CLOS spec.

`:label'
     When customizing an object, the value of :label will be used
     instead of the slot name.  This enables better descriptions of the
     data than would usually be afforded.

     This options is specific to Emacs, and is not in the CLOS spec.

`:group'
     Similar to `defcustom''s :group command, this organizes different
     slots in an object into groups.  When customizing an object, only
     the slots belonging to a specific group need be worked with,
     simplifying the size of the display.

     This options is specific to Emacs, and is not in the CLOS spec.

`:printer'
     This routine takes a symbol which is a function name.  The function
     should accept one argument.  The a rgument is the value from the
     slot to be printed.  The function in `object-write' will write the
     slot value out to a printable form on `standard-output'.

     The output format MUST be  something that could in turn be
     interpreted with `read' such that the object can be brought back
     in from the output stream.  Thus, if you wanted to output a
     symbol, you would need to quote the symbol.  If you wanted to run
     a function on load, you can output the code to do the construction
     of the value.

`:protection'
     When using a slot referencing function such as `slot-value', and
     the value behind SLOT is private or protected, then the current
     scope of operation must be within a method of the calling object.

     Valid values are:

    `:public'
          Access this slot from any scope.

    `:protected'
          Access this slot only from methods of the same class or a
          child class.

    `:private'
          Access this slot only from methods of the same class.

     This options is specific to Emacs, and is not in the CLOS spec.



File: eieio.info,  Node: Class Options,  Prev: Slot Options,  Up: Building Classes

3.3 Class Options
=================

A Class can have class options.  EIEIO supports these class options.

`:documentation'
     Doc string to use for this class.

     If an Emacs style documentation string is also provided, then this
     option is ignored.  An Emacs style documentation string is not
     prefixed by the `:documentation' tag, and appears after the list
     of slots, and before the options.

`:allow-nil-initform'
     If this option is non-nil, and the `:initform' is `nil', but the
     `:type' is specifies something such as `string' then allow this to
     pass.  The default is to have this option be off.  This is
     implemented as an alternative to unbound slots.

     This options is specific to Emacs, and is not in the CLOS spec.

`:abstract'
     A class which is `:abstract' cannot be instantiated, and instead
     is used to define an interface which subclasses should implement.

     This option is specific to Emacs, and is not in the CLOS spec.

`:custom-groups'
     This is a list of groups that can be customized within this class.
     This slot is auto-generated when a class is created and need not
     be specified.  It can be retrieved with the `class-option' command,
     however, to see what groups are available.

     This option is specific to Emacs, and is not in the CLOS spec.

`:method-invocation-order'
     This controls the order in which method resolution occurs for
     `:primary' methods in cases of multiple inheritance.  The order
     affects which method is called first in a tree, and if
     `call-next-method' is used, it controls the order in which the
     stack of methods are run.

     Valid values are:

    `:breadth-first'
          Search for methods in the class hierarchy in breadth first
          order.  This is the default.

    `:depth-first'
          Search for methods in the class hierarchy in a depth first
          order.

     For more on method invocation order, *Note Method Invocation::.

`:metaclass'
     Unsupported CLOS option.  Enables the use of a different base
     class other than `standard-class'.

`:default-initargs'
     Unsupported CLOS option.  Specifies a list of initargs to be used
     when creating new objects.  As far as I can tell, this duplicates
     the function of `:initform'.

   *Note CLOS compatibility::, for more details on CLOS tags versus
EIEIO specific tags.

4 Making New Objects
********************

When simple class is defined, such as:
     (defclass record ()
        ( ) "Doc String")

   it is possible to create create objects of that class type.

   Calling `defclass' has defined two new functions.  One is the
constructor RECORD, and the other is the predicate, RECORD-P.

 -- Function: record object-name &rest slots
     This creates and returns a new object.  This object is not
     assigned to anything, and will be garbage collected if not saved.
     This object will be given the string name OBJECT-NAME.  There can
     be multiple objects of the same name, but the name slot provides a
     handy way to keep track of your objects.  SLOTS is just all the
     slots you wish to preset.  Any slot set as such _will not_ get its
     default value, and any side effects from a slot's `:initform' that
     may be a function will not occur.

     An example pair would appear simply as `:value 1'.  Of course you
     can do any valid Lispy thing you want with it, such as `:value (if
     (boundp 'special-symbol) special-symbol nil)'

     Example of creating an object from a class:

          (record "test" :value 3 :reference nil)


   To create an object from a class symbol, use use `make-instance'.

 -- Function: make-instance class &rest initargs
     Make a new instance of CLASS based on INITARGS.  CLASS is a class
     symbol.  For example:

            (make-instance 'foo)

     INITARGS is a property list with keywords based on the `:initarg'
     for each slot.  For example:

            (make-instance `'foo' `:slot1' value1 `:slotN' valueN)

     Compatability note:

     If the first element of INITARGS is a string, it is used as the
     name of the class.

     In EIEIO, the class' constructor requires a name for use when
     printing.  "make-instance" in CLOS doesn't use names the way Emacs
     does, so the class is used as the name slot instead when INITARGS
     doesn't start with a string.


File: eieio.info,  Node: Accessing Slots,  Next: Writing Methods,  Prev: Making New Objects,  Up: Top

5 Accessing Slots
*****************

There are several ways to access slot values in an object.  The naming
convention and argument order is similar to that found in Emacs Lisp for
referencing vectors.  The basics for referencing, setting, and calling
methods are all accounted for.

 -- Function: oset object slot value
     This sets the value behind SLOT to VALUE in OBJECT.  `oset'
     returns VALUE.

 -- Function: oset-default class slot value
     This sets the `:initform' for SLOT in CLASS to VALUE.  This will
     allow a user to set both public and private defaults after the
     class has been constructed.

     This function provides a way to to configure the default behavior
     of packages built with classes the same way `setq-default' is used
     for buffer-local variables.

     For example, if a user wanted all `data-objects' (*note Building
     Classes::) to inform a special object of his own devising when they
     changed, this can be arranged by simply executing this bit of code:

          (oset-default data-object reference (list my-special-object))


 -- Function: oref obj slot
     Retrieve the value stored in OBJ in the slot named by SLOT.  Slot
     is the name of the slot when created by "defclass" or the label
     created by the `:initarg' tag.

 -- Function: oref-default obj slot
     Gets the default value of OBJ (maybe a class) for SLOT.  The
     default value is the value installed in a class with the
     `:initform' tag.  SLOT can be the slot name, or the tag specified
     by the `:initarg' tag in the "defclass" call.

   These next accessors are defined by CLOS to reference or modify slot
values, and use the previously mentioned set/ref routines.

 -- Function: slot-value object slot
     This function retrieves the value of SLOT from OBJECT.  Unlike
     `oref', the symbol for SLOT must be quoted.

 -- Function: set-slot-value object slot value
     This is not a CLOS function, but is meant to mirror `slot-value' if
     you don't want to use the cl package's `setf' function.  This
     function sets the value of SLOT from OBJECT.  Unlike `oset', the
     symbol for SLOT must be quoted.

 -- Function: slot-makeunbound object slot
     This function unbinds SLOT in OBJECT.  Referencing an unbound slot
     can signal an error.

 -- Function: object-add-to-list object slot item &optional append
     In OBJECT's SLOT, add ITEM to the list of elements.  Optional
     argument APPEND indicates we need to append to the list.  If ITEM
     already exists in the list in SLOT, then it is not added.
     Comparison is done with "equal" through the "member" function call.
     If SLOT is unbound, bind it to the list containing ITEM.

 -- Function: object-remove-from-list object slot item
     In OBJECT's SLOT, remove occurrences of ITEM.  Deletion is done
     with "delete", which deletes by side effect and comparisons are
     done with "equal".  If SLOT is unbound, do nothing.

 -- Function: with-slots spec-list object &rest body
     Bind SPEC-LIST lexically to slot values in OBJECT, and execute
     BODY.  This establishes a lexical environment for referring to the
     slots in the instance named by the given slot-names as though they
     were variables.  Within such a context the value of the slot can be
     specified by using its slot name, as if it were a lexically bound
     variable.  Both setf and setq can be used to set the value of the
     slot.

     SPEC-LIST is of a form similar to "let".  For example:

            ((VAR1 SLOT1)
              SLOT2
              SLOTN
             (VARN+1 SLOTN+1))

     Where each VAR is the local variable given to the associated SLOT.
     A Slot specified without a variable name is given a variable name
     of the same name as the slot.

          (defclass myclass () (x :initarg 1))
          (setq mc (make-instance 'myclass))
          (with-slots (x) mc x)                      => 1
          (with-slots ((something x)) mc something)  => 1

6 Writing Methods
*****************

Writing a method in EIEIO is similar to writing a function.  The
differences are that there are some extra options and there can be
multiple definitions under the same function symbol.

   Where a method defines an implementation for a particular data type,
a "generic method" accepts any argument, but contains no code.  It is
used to provide the dispatching to the defined methods.  A generic
method has no body, and is merely a symbol upon which methods are
attached.  It also provides the base documentation for what methods
with that name do.

* Menu:

* Generics::
* Methods::
* Static Methods::


File: eieio.info,  Node: Generics,  Next: Methods,  Up: Writing Methods

6.1 Generics
============

Every method created in EIEIO will have one corresponding generic.  In
EIEIO the generic provides symbol bound as a function, and the base
documentation

 -- Function: defgeneric method arglist [doc-string]
     METHOD is the unquoted symbol to turn into a function.  ARGLIST is
     the default list of arguments to use (not implemented yet).
     DOC-STRING is the documentation used for this symbol.

     A generic function acts as a place holder for methods.  There is
     no need to call `defgeneric' yourself, as `defmethod' will call it
     if necessary.  Currently the argument list is unused.

     `defgeneric' will prevent you from turning an existing Emacs Lisp
     function into a generic function.

     You can also create a generic method with `defmethod'.  When a
     method is created and there is no generic method in place with that
     name, then a new generic will be created, and the new method will
     use it.

   In CLOS a generic call also be used to provide an argument list, and
dispatch precedence for all the arguments.  In EIEIO, dispatching only
occurs for the first argument, so the ARGLIST is not used.

6.2 Methods
===========

A method is a function which will be executed if the first argument
passed to it matches the class the method was written for.  Multiple
definitions for a single method name can exist, one for each class
defined in EIEIO.

   Methods are created with the `defmethod' macro, which is similar to
`defun'.

 -- Macro: defmethod method [:before | :primary | :after | :static ]
          arglist [doc-string] forms
     METHOD is the name of the function to be created.

     `:before' and `:after' specify execution order, and represent when
     this form is to be called.  If neither of these symbols are
     present, then the default priority is, before `:after', after
     `:before', and is represented in CLOS as `:primary'.

     Note: The `:BEFORE', `:PRIMARY', `:AFTER', and `:STATIC' method
     tags were in all capital letters in previous versions of EIEIO.

     `arglist' is the list of argument to this method.

     DOC-STRING is the documentation attached to the implementation.
     All method doc-strings are concatenated into the generic method's
     function documentation.

     FORMS is the body of the function.


   Only the _first_ argument may have a type specifier.
     (defmethod mymethod ((obj classname) secondarg)
       "Doc string" )

   In this example, `mymethod' has a first argument of OBJ, and this
method will only execute if OBJ is an EIEIO class of type `classname'.

   TODO - The _generic_ term below is not the same as a defgeneric
generic.  The below generic means that there is no type specifier.  FIX
THIS DOC.

   If no type specifier is supplied, then the method becomes a generic
method, which will work for any object.

   A method with no type specifier is a `generic'.  If a given class has
no implementation, then the generic will be called when that method is
used on a given object of that class.

   If two `defmethod's appear with arglists that do not have a type
specifier, then the first implementation will be replaced.  Only one
generic per execution specifier such as `:before', `:primary', or
`:after'.

   When when a method is called on an object, but there is no method
specified for that object, but there is a method specified for object's
parent class, the parent class' method will be called.  If there is a
method defined for both, only the child's method is called.  For a
child method to call a parent's method, use `call-next-method'.

   If multiple methods and generics are defined for the same method and
class, they are executed in this order:

method :before

generic :before

method :primary

generic :primary

method :after

generic :after

   If no methods exist, then the signal and error named
`no-method-definition'. *Note Signals::

   See the file `eieio-test.el' for an example testing these
differently tagged methods.

 -- Function: call-next-method &rest replacement-args
     Call the superclass method from a subclass method.  The superclass
     method is specified in the current method list, and is called the
     next method.

     If REPLACEMENT-ARGS is non-`nil', then use them instead of
     `eieio-generic-call-arglst'.  The generic arg list are the
     arguments passed in at the top level.

     Use "next-method-p" to find out if there is a next method to call.

 -- Function: next-method-p
     Non-`nil' if there is a next method.  Returns a list of lambda
     expressions which is the `next-method' order.

   In this implementation, not all features of CLOS exist.

  1. There is currently no `:around' tag.

  2. CLOS allows multiple sets of type-cast arguments, where EIEIO only
     allows the first argument to be cast.


File: eieio.info,  Node: Static Methods,  Prev: Methods,  Up: Writing Methods

6.3 Static Methods
==================

Static methods do not depend on an object instance, but instead operate
on an object's class.  Create a static method by using the `:static'
key with `defmethod'.

   Do not treat the first argument of a `:static' method as an object
unless you test it first.  Use the functions `oref-default' or
`oset-default' which will work on a class, or on the class of an object.

   A Class' `constructor' method is defined as a `:static' method.

   Note: The `:static' keyword is unique to EIEIO.

   TODO - Write some more about static methods here

8 Predicates and Utilities
**************************

Now that we know how to create classes, access slots, and define
methods, it might be useful to verify that everything is doing ok.  To
help with this a plethora of predicates have been created.

 -- Function: find-class symbol &optional errorp
     Return the class that SYMBOL represents.  If there is no class,
     `nil' is returned if ERRORP is `nil'.  If ERRORP is non-`nil',
     `wrong-argument-type' is signaled.

 -- Function: class-p class
     Return `t' if CLASS is a valid class vector.  CLASS is a symbol.

 -- Function: slot-exists-p object-or-class slot
     Non-`nil' if OBJECT-OR-CLASS has SLOT.

 -- Function: slot-boundp object slot
     Non-`nil' if OBJECT's SLOT is bound.  Setting a slot's value makes
     it bound.  Calling "slot-makeunbound" will make a slot unbound.
     OBJECT can be an instance or a class.

 -- Function: class-name class
     Return a string of the form `#<class myclassname>' which should
     look similar to other Lisp objects like buffers and processes.
     Printing a class results only in a symbol.

 -- Function: class-option class option
     Return the value in CLASS of a given OPTION.  For example:

          (class-option eieio-default-superclass :documentation)

     Will fetch the documentation string for `eieio-default-superclass'.

 -- Function: class-constructor class
     Return a symbol used as a constructor for CLASS.  The constructor
     is a function used to create new instances of CLASS. This function
     provides a way to make an object of a class without knowing what
     it is.  This is not a part of CLOS.

 -- Function: object-name obj
     Return a string of the form `#<object-class myobjname>' for OBJ.
     This should look like Lisp symbols from other parts of emacs such
     as buffers and processes, and is shorter and cleaner than printing
     the object's vector.  It is more useful to use `object-print' to
     get and object's print form, as this allows the object to add
     extra display information into the symbol.

 -- Function: object-class obj
     Returns the class symbol from OBJ.

 -- Function: class-of obj
     CLOS symbol which does the same thing as `object-class'

 -- Function: object-class-fast obj
     Same as `object-class' except this is a macro, and no
     type-checking is performed.

 -- Function: object-class-name obj
     Returns the symbol of OBJ's class.

 -- Function: class-parents class
     Returns the direct parents class of CLASS.  Returns `nil' if it is
     a superclass.

 -- Function: class-parents-fast class
     Just like `class-parent' except it is a macro and no type checking
     is performed.

 -- Function: class-parent class
     Deprecated function which returns the first parent of CLASS.

 -- Function: class-children class
     Return the list of classes inheriting from CLASS.

 -- Function: class-children-fast class
     Just like `class-children', but with no checks.

 -- Function: same-class-p obj class
     Returns `t' if OBJ's class is the same as CLASS.

 -- Function: same-class-fast-p obj class
     Same as `same-class-p' except this is a macro and no type checking
     is performed.

 -- Function: object-of-class-p obj class
     Returns `t' if OBJ inherits anything from CLASS.  This is
     different from `same-class-p' because it checks for inheritance.

 -- Function: child-of-class-p child class
     Returns `t' if CHILD is a subclass of CLASS.

 -- Function: generic-p method-symbol
     Returns `t' if `method-symbol' is a generic function, as opposed
     to a regular Emacs Lisp function.

9 Association Lists
*******************

Lisp offers the concept of association lists, with primitives such as
`assoc' used to access them.  EIEIO provides a few such functions to
help with using lists of objects easily.

 -- Function: object-assoc key slot list
     Return an object if KEY is "equal" to SLOT's value of an object in
     LIST.  LIST is a list of objects who's slots are searched.
     Objects in LIST do not need to have a slot named SLOT, nor does
     SLOT need to be bound.  If these errors occur, those objects will
     be ignored.

 -- Function: object-assoc-list slot list
     Return an association list generated by extracting SLOT from all
     objects in LIST.  For each element of LIST the `car' is the value
     of SLOT, and the `cdr' is the object it was extracted from.  This
     is useful for generating completion tables.

 -- Function: eieio-build-class-alist &optional base-class
     Returns an alist of all currently defined classes.  This alist is
     suitable for completion lists used by interactive functions to
     select a class.  The optional argument BASE-CLASS allows the
     programmer to select only a subset of classes which includes
     BASE-CLASS and all its subclasses.

10 Customizing Objects
**********************

EIEIO supports custom through two new widget types.  If a variable is
declared as type `'object', then full editing of slots via the widgets
is made possible.  This should be used carefully, however, because
objects modified are cloned, so if there are other references to these
objects, they will no longer be linked together.

   If you want in place editing of objects, use the following methods:

 -- Function: eieio-customize-object object
     Create a custom buffer and insert a widget for editing OBJECT.  At
     the end, an `Apply' and `Reset' button are available.  This will
     edit the object "in place" so references to it are also changed.
     There is no effort to prevent multiple edits of a singular object,
     so care must be taken by the user of this function.

 -- Function: eieio-custom-widget-insert object flags
     This method inserts an edit object into the current buffer in
     place.  It is implemented as `(widget-create 'object-edit :value
     object)'.  This method is provided as a locale for adding
     tracking, or specializing the widget insert procedure for any
     object.

   To define a slot with an object in it, use the `object' tag.  This
widget type will be automatically converted to `object-edit' if you do
in place editing of you object.

   If you want to have additional actions taken when a user clicks on
the `Apply' button, then overload the method `eieio-done-customizing'.
This method does nothing by default, but that may change in the future.
This would be the best way to make your objects persistent when using
in-place editing.

10.1 Widget extention
=====================

When widgets are being created, one new widget extention has been added,
called the `:slotofchoices'.  When this occurs in a widget definition,
all elements after it are removed, and the slot is specifies is queried
and converted into a series of constants.

     (choice (const :tag "None" nil)
             :slotofchoices morestuff)

   and if the slot `morestuff' contains `(sym1 sym2 sym3)', the above
example is converted into:

     (choice (const :tag "None" nil)
             (const sym1)
             (const sym2)
             (const sym3))

   This is useful when a given item needs to be selected from a list of
items defined in this second slot.

11 Introspection
****************

Introspection permits a programmer to peek at the contents of a class
without any previous knowledge of that class.  While EIEIO implements
objects on top of vectors, and thus everything is technically visible,
some functions have been provided.  None of these functions are a part
of CLOS.

 -- Function: object-slots obj
     Return the list of public slots for OBJ.

 -- Function: class-slot-initarg class slot
     For the given CLASS return the :initarg associated with SLOT.  Not
     all slots have initargs, so the return value can be nil.

12 Base Classes
***************

Asside from `eieio-default-superclass', EIEIO comes with some
additional classes that you can use.  By using multiple inheritance, it
is possible to use several features at the same time.

* Menu:

* eieio-instance-inheritor::    Enable value inheritance between instances.
* eieio-instance-tracker::      Enable self tracking instances.
* eieio-singleton::             Only one instance of a given class.
* eieio-persistent::            Enable persistence for a class.
* eieio-named::                 Use the object name as a :name slot.
* eieio-speedbar::              Enable speedbar support in your objects.


File: eieio.info,  Node: eieio-instance-inheritor,  Next: eieio-instance-tracker,  Up: Base Classes

12.1 `eieio-instance-inheritor'
===============================

This class is in package `eieio-base'.

   Instance inheritance is a mechanism whereby the value of a slot in
object instance can reference the parent instance.  If the parent's slot
value is changed, then the child instance is also changed.  If the
child's slot is set, then the parent's slot is not modified.

 -- Class: eieio-instance-inheritor parent-instance
     A class whose instances are enabled with instance inheritance.
     The PARENT-INSTANCE slot indicates the instance which is
     considered the parent of the current instance.  Default is `nil'.

   To use this class, inherit from it with your own class.  To make a
new instance that inherits from and existing instance of your class,
use the `clone' method with additional parameters to specify local
values.

   The `eieio-instance-inheritor' class works by causing cloned objects
to have all slots unbound.  This class' `slot-unbound' method will
cause references to unbound slots to be redirected to the parent
instance.  If the parent slot is also unbound, then `slot-unbound' will
signal an an error named `slot-unbound'.

12.2 `eieio-instance-tracker'
=============================

This class is in package `eieio-base'.

   Sometimes it is useful to keep a master list of all instances of a
given class.  The class `eieio-instance-tracker' performs this task.

 -- Class: eieio-instance-tracker tracker-symbol
     Enable instance tracking for this class.  The slot TRACKER-SYMBOL
     should be initialized in inheritors of this class to a symbol
     created with `defvar'.  This symbol will serve as the variable
     used as a master list of all objects of the given class.

 -- Method on eieio-instance-tracker: initialize-instance obj slot
     This method is defined as an `:after' method.  It adds new
     instances to the master list.  Do not overload this method unless
     you use `call-next-method.'

 -- Method on eieio-instance-tracker: delete-instance obj
     Remove OBJ from the master list of instances of this class.  This
     may let the garbage collector nab this instance.

 -- eieio-instance-tracker-find: key slot list-symbol
     This convenience function lets you find instances.  KEY is the
     value to search for.  SLOT is the slot to compare KEY against.
     The function `equal' is used for comparison.  The paramter
     LIST-SYMBOL is the variable symbol which contains the list of
     objects to be searched.

12.3 `eieio-singleton'
======================

This class is in package `eieio-base'.

 -- Class: eieio-singleton
     Inheriting from the singleton class will guarantee that there will
     only ever be one instance of this class.  Multiple calls to
     `make-instance' will always return the same object.


File: eieio.info,  Node: eieio-persistent,  Next: eieio-named,  Prev: eieio-singleton,  Up: Base Classes

12.4 `eieio-persistent'
=======================

This class is in package `eieio-base'.

   If you want an object, or set of objects to be persistent, meaning
the slot values are important to keep saved between sessions, then you
will want your top level object to inherit from `eieio-persistent'.

   To make sure your persistent object can be moved, make sure all file
names stored to disk are made relative with
`eieio-persistent-path-relative'.

 -- Class: eieio-persistent file file-header-line
     Enables persistence for instances of this class.  Slot FILE with
     initarg `:file' is the file name in which this object will be
     saved.  Class allocated slot FILE-HEADER-LINE is used with method
     `object-write' as a header comment.

   All objects can write themselves to a file, but persistent objects
have several additional methods that aid in maintaining them.

 -- Method on eieio-persistent: eieio-persistent-save obj &optional file
     Write the object OBJ to its file.  If optional argument FILE is
     specified, use that file name instead.

 -- Method on eieio-persistent: eieio-persistent-path-relative obj file
     Return a file name derived from FILE which is relative to the
     stored location of OBJ.  This method should be used to convert
     file names so that they are relative to the save file, making any
     system of files movable from one location to another.

 -- Method on eieio-persistent: object-write obj &optional comment
     Like `object-write' for `standard-object', but will derive a
     header line comment from the class allocated slot if one is not
     provided.

 -- Function: eieio-persistent-read filename
     Read FILENAME which contains an `eieio-persistent' object
     previously written with `eieio-persistent-save'.

12.5 `eieio-named'
==================

This class is in package `eieio-base'.

 -- Class: eieio-named
     Object with a name.  Name storage already occurs in an object.
     This object provides get/set access to it.

12.6 `eieio-speedbar'
=====================

This class is in package `eieio-speedbar'.

   If a series of class instances map to a tree structure, it is
possible to cause your classes to be displayable in Speedbar. *Note
Top: (speedbar)Top.  Inheriting from these classes will enable a
speedbar major display mode with a minimum of effort.

 -- Class: eieio-speedbar buttontype buttonface
     Enables base speedbar display for a class.  The slot BUTTONTYPE is
     any of the symbols allowed by the function
     `speedbar-make-tag-line' for the EXP-BUTTON-TYPE argument *Note
     Extending: (speedbar)Extending.  The slot BUTTONFACE is the face
     to use for the text of the string displayed in speedbar.  The
     slots BUTTONTYPE and BUTTONFACE are class allocated slots, and do
     not take up space in your instances.

 -- Class: eieio-speedbar-directory-button buttontype buttonface
     This class inherits from `eieio-speedbar' and initializes
     BUTTONTYPE and BUTTONFACE to appear as directory level lines.

 -- Class: eieio-speedbar-file-button buttontype buttonface
     This class inherits from `eieio-speedbar' and initializes
     BUTTONTYPE and BUTTONFACE to appear as file level lines.

   To use these classes, inherit from one of them in you class.  You can
use multiple inheritance with them safely.  To customize your class for
speedbar display, override the default values for BUTTONTYPE and
BUTTONFACE to get the desired effects.

   Useful methods to define for your new class include:

 -- Method on eieio-speedbar: eieio-speedbar-derive-line-path obj depth
     Return a string representing a directory associated with an
     instance of OBJ.  DEPTH can be used to indice how many levels of
     indentation have been opened by the user where OBJ is shown.

 -- Method on eieio-speedbar: eieio-speedbar-description obj
     Return a string description of OBJ.  This is shown in the
     minibuffer or tooltip when the mouse hovers over this instance in
     speedbar.

 -- Method on eieio-speedbar: eieio-speedbar-child-description obj
     Return a string representing a description of a child node of OBJ
     when that child is not an object.  It is often useful to just use
     item info helper functions such as
     `speedbar-item-info-file-helper'.

 -- Method on eieio-speedbar: eieio-speedbar-object-buttonname obj
     Return a string which is the text displayed in speedbar for OBJ.

 -- Method on eieio-speedbar: eieio-speedbar-object-children obj
     Return a list of children of OBJ.

 -- Method on eieio-speedbar: eieio-speedbar-child-make-tag-lines obj
          depth
     This method inserts a list of speedbar tag lines for OBJ to
     represent its children.  Implement this method for your class if
     your children are not objects themselves.  You still need to
     implement `eieio-speedbar-object-children'.

     In this method, use techniques specified in the Speedbar manual.
     *Note Extending: (speedbar)Extending.

   Some other functions you will need to learn to use are:

 -- eieio-speedbar-create: make-map key-map menu name toplevelfn
     Register your object display mode with speedbar.  MAKE-MAP is a
     function which initialized you keymap.  KEY-MAP is a symbol you
     keymap is installed into.  MENU is an easy menu vector
     representing menu items specific to your object display.  NAME is
     a short string to use as a name identifying you mode.  TOPLEVELFN
     is a function called which must return a list of objects
     representing those in the instance system you wish to browse in
     speedbar.

     Read the Extending chapter in the speedbar manual for more
     information on how speedbar modes work *Note Extending:

13 Browsing class trees
***********************

To browse all the currently loaded classes in emacs, simply run the
EIEIO browser.  `M-x eieio-browse'.  This browses all the way from the
default super-duper class eieio-default-superclass, and lists all
children in an indented tree structure.

   To browse only from a specific class, pass it in as an alternate
parameter.

   Here is a sample tree from our current example:

     eieio-default-superclass
       +--data-object
            +--data-object-symbol

   Note that we start with eieio-default-superclass.  *Note Default
Superclass::.

   Note: new classes are consed into the inheritance lists, so the tree
comes out upside-down.

14 Class Values
***************

Details about any class or object can be retrieved using the function
`eieio-describe-class' function.  Interactively, type in the name of a
class.  In a program, pass it a string with the name of a class, a
class symbol, or an object.  The resulting buffer will display all slot
names.

   Additionally, all methods defined to have functionality on this
class is displayed.

15 Documentation
****************

It is possible to automatically create documentation for your classes in
texinfo format by using the tools in the file `eieio-doc.el'

 -- Command: eieiodoc-class class indexstring &optional skiplist
     This will start at the current point, and created an indented menu
     of all the child classes of, and including CLASS, but skipping any
     classes that might be in SKIPLIST It will then create nodes for
     all these classes, subsection headings, and indexes.

     Each class will be indexed using the texinfo labeled index
     INDEXSTRING which is a two letter description.  *Note (texinfo)
     New Indices::.

     To use this command, the texinfo macro

          @defindex @var { indexstring }

     where INDEXSTRING is replaced with the two letter code.

     Next, an inheritance tree will be created listing all parents of
     that section's class.

     Then,all the slots will be expanded in tables, and described using
     the documentation strings from the code.  Default values will also
     be displayed.  Only those slots with `:initarg' specified will be
     expanded, others will be hidden.  If a slot is inherited from a
     parent, that slot will also be skipped unless the default value is
     different.  If there is a change, then the documentation part of
     the slot will be replace with an @xref back to the parent.

     This command can only display documentation for classes whose
     definitions have been loaded in this Emacs session.

16 Default Superclass
*********************

All defined classes, if created with no specified parent class) will
inherit from a special class stored in `eieio-default-superclass'.
This superclass is quite simple, but with it, certain default methods
or attributes can be added to all objects.  In CLOS, this would be
named `STANDARD-CLASS', and that symbol is an alias to
`eieio-default-superclass'.

   Currently, the default superclass is defined as follows:

     (defclass eieio-default-superclass nil
       nil
       "Default parent class for classes with no specified parent class.
     Its slots are automatically adopted by classes with no specified
     parents.  This class is not stored in the `parent' slot of a class vector."
       :abstract t)

   The default superclass implements several methods providing a default
behavior for all objects created by EIEIO.

* Menu:

* Initialization::      How objects are initialized
* Basic Methods::       Clone, print, and write
* Signal Handling::     Methods for managing signals.


File: eieio.info,  Node: Initialization,  Next: Basic Methods,  Up: Default Superclass

16.1 Initialization
===================

When creating an object of any type, you can use its constructor, or
`make-instance'.  This, in turns calls the method
`initialize-instance', which then calls the method `shared-initialize'.

   These methods are all implemented on the default superclass so you do
not need to write them yourself, unless you need to override one of
their behaviors.

   Users should not need to call `initialize-instance' or
`shared-initialize', as these are used by `make-instance' to initialize
the object.  They are instead provided so that users can augment these
behaviors.

 -- Function: initialize-instance obj &rest slots
     Initialize OBJ.  Sets slots of OBJ with SLOTS which is a list of
     name/value pairs.  These are actually just passed to
     `shared-initialize'.

 -- Function: shared-initialize obj &rest slots
     Sets slots of OBJ with SLOTS which is a list of name/value pairs.

     This is called from the default `constructor'.


File: eieio.info,  Node: Basic Methods,  Next: Signal Handling,  Prev: Initialization,  Up: Default Superclass

16.2 Basic Methods
==================

Additional useful methods defined on the base sublcass are:

 -- Function: clone obj &rest params
     Make a copy of OBJ, and then apply PARAMS.  PARAMS is a parameter
     list of the same form as INITIALIZE-INSTANCE which are applied to
     change the object.  When overloading "clone", be sure to call
     "call-next-method" first and modify the returned object.

 -- Function: object-print this &rest strings
     Pretty printer for object THIS.  Call function "object-name" with
     STRINGS.  The default method for printing object THIS is to use the
     function "object-name".

     It is sometimes useful to put a summary of the object into the
     default #<notation> string when using eieio browsing tools.

     Implement this function and specify STRINGS in a call to
     "call-next-method" to provide additional summary information.
     When passing in extra strings from child classes, always remember
     to prepend a space.

          (defclass data-object ()
             (value)
             "Object containing one data slot.")

          (defmethod object-print ((this data-object) &optional strings)
            "Return a string with a summary of the data object as part of the name."
            (apply 'call-next-method this
                   (cons (format " value: %s" (render this)) strings)))

     here is what some output could look like:
          (object-print test-object)
             => #<data-object test-object value: 3>

 -- Function: object-write obj &optional comment
     Write OBJ onto a stream in a readable fashion.  The resulting
     output will be Lisp code which can be used with `read' and `eval'
     to recover the object.  Only slots with `:initarg's are written to
     the stream.


File: eieio.info,  Node: Signal Handling,  Prev: Basic Methods,  Up: Default Superclass

16.3 Signal Handling
====================

The default superclass defines methods for managing error conditions.
These methods all throw a signal for a particular error condition.

   By implementing one of these methods for a class, you can change the
behavior that occurs during one of these error cases, or even ignore
the error by providing some behavior.

 -- Function: slot-missing ab &rest foo
     Method invoked when an attempt to access a slot in OBJECT fails.
     SLOT-NAME is the name of the failed slot, OPERATION is the type of
     access that was requested, and optional NEW-VALUE is the value
     that was desired to be set.

     This method is called from `oref', `oset', and other functions
     which directly reference slots in EIEIO objects.

     The default method signals an error of type `invalid-slot-name'.
     *Note Signals::.

     You may override this behavior, but it is not expected to return
     in the current implementation.

     This function takes arguments in a different order than in CLOS.

 -- Function: slot-unbound object class slot-name fn
     Slot unbound is invoked during an attempt to reference an unbound
     slot.  OBJECT is the instance of the object being reference.
     CLASS is the class of OBJECT, and SLOT-NAME is the offending slot.
     This function throws the signal `unbound-slot'.  You can overload
     this function and return the value to use in place of the unbound
     value.  Argument FN is the function signaling this error.  Use
     "slot-boundp" to determine if a slot is bound or not.

     In CLOS, the argument list is (CLASS OBJECT SLOT-NAME), but EIEIO
     can only dispatch on the first argument, so the first two are
     swapped.

 -- Function: no-applicable-method object method &rest args
     Called if there are no implementations for OBJECT in METHOD.
     OBJECT is the object which has no method implementation.  ARGS are
     the arguments that were passed to METHOD.

     Implement this for a class to block this signal.  The return value
     becomes the return value of the original method call.

 -- Function: no-next-method object &rest args
     Called from "call-next-method" when no additional methods are
     available.  OBJECT is othe object being called on
     "call-next-method".  ARGS are the  arguments it is called by.
     This method signals "no-next-method" by default.  Override this
     method to not throw an error, and it's return value becomes the
     return value of "call-next-method".


File: eieio.info,  Node: Signals,  Next: Naming Conventions,  Prev: Default Superclass,  Up: Top

17 Signals
**********

There are new condition names (signals) that can be caught when using
EIEIO.

 -- Signal: invalid-slot-name obj-or-class slot
     This signal is called when an attempt to reference a slot in an
     OBJ-OR-CLASS is made, and the SLOT is not defined for it.

 -- Signal: no-method-definition method arguments
     This signal is called when METHOD is called, with ARGUMENTS and
     nothing is resolved.  This occurs when METHOD has been defined,
     but the arguments make it impossible for EIEIO to determine which
     method body to run.

     To prevent this signal from occurring in your class, implement the
     method `no-applicable-method' for your class.  This method is
     called when to throw this signal, so implementing this for your
     class allows you block the signal, and perform some work.

 -- Signal: no-next-method class arguments
     This signal is called if the function `call-next-method' is called
     and there is no next method to be called.

     Overload the method `no-next-method' to protect against this
     signal.

 -- Signal: invalid-slot-type slot spec value
     This signal is called when an attempt to set SLOT is made, and
     VALUE doesn't match the specified type SPEC.

     In EIEIO, this is also used if a slot specifier has an invalid
     value during a `defclass'.

 -- Signal: unbound-slot object class slot
     This signal is called when an attempt to reference SLOT in OBJECT
     is made, and that instance is currently unbound.

18 Naming Conventions
*********************

The Emacs Lisp programming manual has a great chapter programming
conventions that help keep each Emacs package working nicely with the
entire system.  *Note (elisp)Standards:: An EIEIO based program needs to
follow these conventions, while simultaneously taking advantage of the
Object Oriented features.

   Here is how the Emacs Lisp naming conventions (*note
(elisp)Standards::) apply to EIEIO:

   * Come up with a package prefix that is relatively short.  Prefix
     all classes, and methods with your prefix.  This is a standard
     convention for functions and variables in Emacs.

   * Do not prefix method names with the class name.  All methods in
     EIEIO are "virtual", and are dynamically dispatched.  Anyone can
     override your methods at any time.  Your methods should be prefixed
     with your package name.

   * Do not prefix slots in your class.  The slots are always locally
     scoped to your class, and need no prefixing.

   * If your library inherits from other libraries of classes, you must
     "require" that library with the `require' command.

19 CLOS compatibility
*********************

As you read this, it is important to know that I have just recently
learned some of the CLOS syntax, but have never used it myself outside
of the EIEIO framework.  I'm primarily and Emacs Lisp hacker who wrote
EIEIO to help myself learn some of the mechanics of Object Oriented
programming.

   Currently, the following functions should behave almost as expected
from CLOS.

`defclass'
     All slot keywords are available but not all work correctly.  Slot
     keyword differences are:

    :reader, and :writer tags
          Create methods that signal errors instead of creating an
          unqualified method.  You can still create new ones to do its
          business.

    :accessor
          This should create an unqualified method to access a slot, but
          instead pre-builds a method that gets the slot's value.

    :type
          Specifier uses the `typep' function from the `cl' package.
          *Note (cl)Type Predicates::. It therefore has the same issues
          as that package.  Extensions include the ability to provide
          object names.

     Defclass also supports class options, but does not currently use
     values of `:metaclass', and `:default-initargs'.

`make-instance'
     Make instance works as expected, however it just uses the EIEIO
     instance creator automatically generated when a new class is
     created.  *Note Making New Objects::.

`defgeneric'
     Creates the desired symbol, and accepts all of the expected
     arguments except `:around'.

`defmethod'
     Calls defgeneric, and accepts most of the expected arguments.  Only
     the first argument to the created method may have a type specifier.
     To type cast against a class, the class must exist before
     defmethod is called. In addition, the `:around' tag is not
     supported.

`call-next-method'
     Inside a method, calls the next available method up the
     inheritance tree for the given object.  This is different than
     that found in CLOS because in EIEIO this function accepts
     replacement arguments.  This permits subclasses to modify
     arguments as they are passed up the tree.  If no arguments are
     given, the expected CLOS behavior is used.

`setf'
     If the common-lisp subsystem is loaded, the setf parameters are
     also loaded so the form `(setf (slot-value object slot) t)' should
     work.

   CLOS supports the `describe' command, but EIEIO only provides
`eieio-describe-class', and `eieio-describe-generic'.  These functions
are adviced into `describe-variable', and `describe-function'.

   When creating a new class (*note Building Classes::) there are
several new keywords supported by EIEIO.

   In EIEIO tags are in lower case, not mixed case.

20 Wish List
************

EIEIO is an incomplete implementation of CLOS.  Finding ways to improve
the compatability would help make CLOS style programs run better in
Emacs.

   Some important compatability features that would be good to add are:

  1. `:around' method key.

  2. Method dispatch for built-in types.

  3. Method dispatch for multiple argument typing.

  4. Improve integration with the `cl' package.

   There are also improvements to be made to allow EIEIO to operate
better in the Emacs environment.

  1. Allow subclasing of Emacs built-in types, such as faces, markers,
     and buffers.

  2. Allow method overloading of method-like functions in Emacs.
