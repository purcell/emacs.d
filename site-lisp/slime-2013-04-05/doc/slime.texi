@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

@SLIME{} is the ``Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs.''

@SLIME{} extends Emacs with support for interactive programming in
Common Lisp. The features are centered around @code{slime-mode}, an
Emacs minor-mode that complements the standard @code{lisp-mode}. While
@code{lisp-mode} supports editing Lisp source files, @code{slime-mode}
adds support for interacting with a running Common Lisp process for
compilation, debugging, documentation lookup, and so on.

The @code{slime-mode} programming environment follows the example of
Emacs's native Emacs Lisp environment. We have also included good
ideas from similar systems (such as @acronym{ILISP}) and some new
ideas of our own.

@SLIME{} is constructed from two parts: a user-interface written in
Emacs Lisp, and a supporting server program written in Common
Lisp. The two sides are connected together with a socket and
communicate using an @acronym{RPC}-like protocol.

The Lisp server is primarily written in portable Common Lisp. The
required implementation-specific functionality is specified by a
well-defined interface and implemented separately for each Lisp
implementation. This makes @SLIME{} readily portable.

@node Platforms
@section Supported Platforms

@SLIME{} supports a wide range of operating systems and Lisp
implementations. @SLIME{} runs on Unix systems, Mac OSX, and Microsoft
Windows. GNU Emacs versions 21, 22, and 23 and XEmacs version 21 are
supported.

The supported Lisp implementations, roughly ordered from the
best-supported, are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
CMU Common Lisp (@acronym{CMUCL}), 19d or newer
@item
Steel Bank Common Lisp (@acronym{SBCL}), 1.0 or newer
@item
Clozure Common Lisp (@acronym{CCL}), version 1.3 or newer
@item
LispWorks, version 4.3 or newer
@item
Allegro Common Lisp (@acronym{ACL}), version 6 or newer
@item
@acronym{CLISP}, version 2.35 or newer
@item
Armed Bear Common Lisp (@acronym{ABCL})
@item
Corman Common Lisp, version 2.51 or newer with the
patches from @url{http://www.grumblesmurf.org/lisp/corman-patches})
@item
Scieneer Common Lisp (@acronym{SCL}), version 1.2.7 or newer
@item
Embedded Common Lisp (@acronym{ECL})
@end itemize

Most features work uniformly across implementations, but some are
prone to variation. These include the precision of placing
compiler-note annotations, @acronym{XREF} support, and fancy debugger
commands (like ``restart frame'').

@node Downloading
@section Downloading SLIME

You can choose between using a released version of @SLIME{} or
accessing our @CVS{} repository directly. You can download the latest
released version from our website:

@url{http://www.common-lisp.net/project/slime/}

We recommend that users who participate in the @code{slime-devel}
mailing list use the @CVS{} version of the code.

@menu
* CVS::                         
* CVS Incantations::            
@end menu

@c ----------------------- 
@node CVS
@subsection Downloading from CVS

@SLIME{} is available from the @CVS{} repository on
@file{common-lisp.net}. You have the option to use either the very
latest code or the tagged @code{FAIRLY-STABLE} snapshot.

The latest version tends to have more features and fewer bugs than the
@code{FAIRLY-STABLE} version, but it can be unstable during times of
major surgery. As a rule-of-thumb recommendation we suggest that if
you follow the @code{slime-devel} mailing list then you're better off
with the latest version (we'll send a note when it's undergoing major
hacking). If you don't follow the mailing list you won't know the
status of the latest code, so tracking @code{FAIRLY-STABLE} or using a
released version is the safe option.

If you checkout from @CVS{} then remember to @code{cvs update}
occasionally.  Improvements are continually being committed, and the
@code{FAIRLY-STABLE} tag is moved forward from time to time.

@menu
* CVS Incantations::            
@end menu

@c ----------------------- 
@node CVS Incantations
@subsection CVS incantations

To download @SLIME{} you first configure your @code{CVSROOT} and login
to the repository.

@example
export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@@common-lisp.net:/project/slime/cvsroot
cvs login
@end example
@emph{(The password is @code{anonymous})}

The latest version can then be checked out with:
@example
cvs checkout slime
@end example

Or the @code{FAIRLY-STABLE} version can be checked out with:

@example
cvs checkout -rFAIRLY-STABLE slime
@end example

If you want to find out what's new since the version you're currently
running, you can diff the local @file{ChangeLog} against the
repository version:

@example
cvs diff -rHEAD ChangeLog      # or: -rFAIRLY-STABLE
@end example

@c ----------------------- 
@node Installation
@section Installation

With a Lisp implementation that can be started from the command-line,
installation just requires a few lines in your @file{.emacs}:

@vindex inferior-lisp-program
@vindex load-path
@vindex slime-setup
@example 
(setq inferior-lisp-program "/opt/sbcl/bin/sbcl") ; @emph{your Lisp system}
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/hacking/lisp/slime/")  ; @emph{your SLIME directory}
(require 'slime)
(slime-setup)
@end example

@c @iftex
The snippet above also appears in the @file{README} file. You can
copy&paste it from there, but remember to fill in the appropriate
paths.
@c @end iftex

This is the minimal configuration with the fewest frills.  If the
basic setup is working, you can try additional modules (@ref{Loading
Contribs}).

We recommend not loading the @acronym{ILISP} package into Emacs if you
intend to use @SLIME{}. Doing so will add a lot of extra bindings to
the keymap for Lisp source files that may be confusing and may not
work correctly for a Lisp process started by @SLIME{}.


@c ----------------------- 
@node Running
@section Running SLIME

@SLIME{} is started with the Emacs command @kbd{M-x slime}. This uses
the @code{inferior-lisp} package to start a Lisp process, loads and
starts the Lisp-side server (known as ``Swank''), and establishes a
socket connection between Emacs and Lisp. Finally a @REPL{} buffer is
created where you can enter Lisp expressions for evaluation.

At this point @SLIME{} is up and running and you can start exploring.

@node Setup Tuning
@section Setup Tuning

This section explains ways to reduce @SLIME{}'s startup time and how
to configure @SLIME{} for multiple Lisp systems.  

Please proceed with this section only if your basic setup works.  If
you are happy with the basic setup, skip this section.

For contrib modules @pxref{Loading Contribs}.

@menu
* Autoloading::                 
* Multiple Lisps::              
* Loading Swank faster::        
@end menu

@node Autoloading
@subsection Autoloading

The basic setup loads @SLIME{} always, even if you don't use @SLIME{}.
Emacs will start up a little faster if we load @SLIME{} only on
demand.  To achieve that, you have to change your @file{~/.emacs}
slightly:

@example
(setq inferior-lisp-program "@emph{the path to your Lisp system}")
(add-to-list 'load-path "@emph{the path of your @file{slime} directory}")
(require 'slime-autoloads)
(slime-setup)
@end example

The only difference compared to the basic setup is the line
@code{(require 'slime-autoloads)}.  It tells Emacs that the rest of
@SLIME{} should be loaded automatically when one of the commands
@kbd{M-x slime} or @kbd{M-x slime-connect} is executed the first time.

@node Multiple Lisps
@subsection Multiple Lisps

By default, the command @kbd{M-x slime} starts the program specified
with @code{inferior-lisp-program}.  If you invoke @kbd{M-x slime} with
a prefix argument, Emacs prompts for the program which should be
started instead.  If you need that frequently or if the command
involves long filenames it's more convenient to set the
@code{slime-lisp-implementations} variable in your @file{.emacs}.  For
example here we define two programs:

@vindex slime-lisp-implementations
@lisp
(setq slime-lisp-implementations
      '((cmucl ("cmucl" "-quiet"))
        (sbcl ("/opt/sbcl/bin/sbcl") :coding-system utf-8-unix)))
@end lisp

@vindex slime-default-lisp
This variable holds a list of programs and if you invoke @SLIME{} with
a negative prefix argument, @kbd{M-- M-x slime}, you can select a
program from that list. When called without a prefix, either the name
specified in @code{slime-default-lisp}, or the first item of the list will be used.
The elements of the list should look like

@lisp
(NAME (PROGRAM PROGRAM-ARGS...) &key CODING-SYSTEM INIT INIT-FUNCTION ENV)
@end lisp

@table @code
@item NAME
is a symbol and is used to identify the program.
@item PROGRAM
is the filename of the program.  Note that the filename can contain
spaces.
@item PROGRAM-ARGS
is a list of command line arguments.  
@item CODING-SYSTEM
the coding system for the connection.  (@pxref{slime-net-coding-system})x
@item INIT
should be a function which takes two arguments: a filename and a
character encoding.  The function should return a Lisp expression as a
string which instructs Lisp to start the Swank server and to write the
port number to the file.  At startup, @SLIME{} starts the Lisp process
and sends the result of this function to Lisp's standard input.  As
default, @code{slime-init-command} is used.  An example is shown in
@ref{init-example,,Loading Swank faster}.
@itemx INIT-FUNCTION
should be a function which takes no arguments.  It is called after 
the connection is established. (See also @ref{slime-connected-hook}.)
@item ENV
specifies a list of environment variables for the subprocess. E.g.
@lisp
(sbcl-cvs ("/home/me/sbcl-cvs/src/runtime/sbcl" 
           "--core" "/home/me/sbcl-cvs/output/sbcl.core")
          :env ("SBCL_HOME=/home/me/sbcl-cvs/contrib/"))
@end lisp
initializes @code{SBCL_HOME} in the subprocess.
@end table

@node Loading Swank faster
@subsection Loading Swank faster

For SBCL, we recommend that you create a custom core file with socket
support and @acronym{POSIX} bindings included because those modules
take the most time to load.  To create such a core, execute the
following steps:

@example
shell$ sbcl
* (mapc 'require '(sb-bsd-sockets sb-posix sb-introspect sb-cltl2 asdf))
* (save-lisp-and-die "sbcl.core-for-slime")
@end example

After that, add something like this to your @file{.emacs}:

@lisp
(setq slime-lisp-implementations 
      '((sbcl ("sbcl" "--core" "sbcl.core-for-slime"))))
@end lisp

For maximum startup speed you can include the Swank server directly in
a core file.  The disadvantage of this approach is that the setup is a
bit more involved and that you need to create a new core file when you
want to update @SLIME{} or @acronym{SBCL}.  The steps to execute are:

@example
shell$ sbcl
* (load ".../slime/swank-loader.lisp")
* (swank-loader:dump-image "sbcl.core-with-swank")
@end example

@noindent
Then add this to your @file{.emacs}:

@anchor{init-example}
@lisp
(setq slime-lisp-implementations 
      '((sbcl ("sbcl" "--core" "sbcl.core-with-swank")
              :init (lambda (port-file _)
                      (format "(swank:start-server %S)\n" port-file)))))
@end lisp

@noindent
Similar setups should also work for other Lisp implementations.

@chapter Using Slime mode

@SLIME{}'s commands are provided via @code{slime-mode}, a minor-mode

@node User-interface conventions
@section User-interface conventions

To use @SLIME{} comfortably it is important to understand a few
``global'' user-interface characteristics. The most important
principles are described in this section.

@menu
* Temporary buffers::           
* Inferior-lisp::               
* Multithreading::              
* Key bindings::                
@end menu

@c ----------------------- 
@node Temporary buffers
@subsection Temporary buffers

Some @SLIME{} commands create temporary buffers to display their
results. Although these buffers usually have their own special-purpose
major-modes, certain conventions are observed throughout.

Temporary buffers can be dismissed by pressing @kbd{q}. This kills the
buffer and restores the window configuration as it was before the
buffer was displayed. Temporary buffers can also be killed with the
usual commands like @code{kill-buffer}, in which case the previous
window configuration won't be restored.

Pressing @kbd{RET} is supposed to ``do the most obvious useful
thing.'' For instance, in an apropos buffer this prints a full
description of the symbol at point, and in an @acronym{XREF} buffer it
displays the source code for the reference at point. This convention
is inherited from Emacs's own buffers for apropos listings,
compilation results, etc.

Temporary buffers containing Lisp symbols use @code{slime-mode} in
addition to any special mode of their own. This makes the usual
@SLIME{} commands available for describing symbols, looking up
function definitions, and so on.

@vindex slime-description-autofocus
Initial focus of those ``description'' buffers depends on the variable
@code{slime-description-autofocus}. If @code{nil} (the default),
description buffers do not receive focus automatically, and vice
versa.

@c ----------------------- 
@node Inferior-lisp
@subsection @code{*inferior-lisp*} buffer

@SLIME{} internally uses the @code{comint} package to start Lisp
processes. This has a few user-visible consequences, some good and
some not-so-terribly. To avoid confusion it is useful to understand
the interactions.

The buffer @code{*inferior-lisp*} contains the Lisp process's own
top-level. This direct access to Lisp is useful for troubleshooting,
and some degree of @SLIME{} integration is available using the
inferior-slime-mode.  Many people load the better integrated @SLIME{}
@REPL{} contrib module (@pxref{REPL}) and ignore
the @code{*inferior-lisp*} buffer.  (@pxref{Loading Contribs} for
information on how to enable the REPL.)

@c ----------------------- 
@node Multithreading
@subsection Multithreading

If the Lisp system supports multithreading, SLIME spawns a new thread
for each request, e.g., @kbd{C-x C-e} creates a new thread to evaluate
the expression.  An exception to this rule are requests from the
@REPL{}: all commands entered in the @REPL{} buffer are evaluated in a
dedicated @REPL{} thread.

Some complications arise with multithreading and special variables.
Non-global special bindings are thread-local, e.g., changing the value
of a let bound special variable in one thread has no effect on the
binding of the variables with the same name in other threads.  This
makes it sometimes difficult to change the printer or reader behaviour
for new threads.  The variable
@code{swank:*default-worker-thread-bindings*} was introduced for such
situations: instead of modifying the global value of a variable, add a
binding the @code{swank:*default-worker-thread-bindings*}.  E.g., with
the following code, new threads will read floating point values as
doubles by default:

@example
(push '(*read-default-float-format* . double-float)
       swank:*default-worker-thread-bindings*).
@end example


@node Key bindings
@subsection Key bindings

In general we try to make our key bindings fit with the overall Emacs
style. We also have the following somewhat unusual convention of our
own: when entering a three-key sequence, the final key can be pressed
either with control or unmodified. For example, the
@code{slime-describe-symbol} command is bound to @kbd{C-c C-d d}, but
it also works to type @kbd{C-c C-d C-d}. We're simply binding both key
sequences because some people like to hold control for all three keys
and others don't, and with the two-key prefix we're not afraid of
running out of keys.

There is one exception to this rule, just to trip you up. We never
bind @kbd{C-h} anywhere in a key sequence, so @kbd{C-c C-d C-h}
doesn't do the same thing as @kbd{C-c C-d h}. This is because Emacs
has a built-in default so that typing a prefix followed by @kbd{C-h}
will display all bindings starting with that prefix, so @kbd{C-c C-d
C-h} will actually list the bindings for all documentation commands.
This feature is just a bit too useful to clobber!

@quotation
@i{``Are you deliberately spiting Emacs's brilliant online help facilities? The gods will be angry!''}
@end quotation

@noindent This is a brilliant piece of advice. The Emacs online help facilities
are your most immediate, up-to-date and complete resource for keybinding
information. They are your friends:

@table @kbd
@kbdanchorc{C-h k <key>, describe-key, ``What does this key do?''} 
Describes current function bound to @kbd{<key>} for focus buffer. 

@kbdanchorc{C-h b, describe-bindings, ``Exactly what bindings are available?''} 
Lists the current key-bindings for the focus buffer. 

@kbdanchorc{C-h m, describe-mode, ``Tell me all about this mode''}
Shows all the available major mode keys, then the minor mode keys, for
the modes of the focus buffer.

@kbdanchorc{C-h l, view-lossage, ``Woah@comma{} what key chord did I just do?''} 
Shows you the literal sequence of keys you've pressed in order. 

@c <key> is breaks links PDF, despite that it's not l it's C-h
@c @kbdanchorc{ <key> l, , ``What starts with?''} 
@c Lists all keybindings that begin with @code{<key>} for the focus buffer mode. 


@end table

@emph{Note:} In this documentation the designation @kbd{C-h} is a
@dfn{canonical key} which might actually mean Ctrl-h, or F1, or
whatever you have @code{help-command} bound to in your
@code{.emacs}. Here is a common situation:

@example
(global-set-key [f1]   'help-command)
(global-set-key "\C-h" 'delete-backward-char)
@end example

@noindent In this situation everywhere you see @kbd{C-h} in the 
documentation you would substitute @kbd{F1}.

You can assign or change default key bindings globally using the
@code{global-set-key} function in your @file{~/.emacs} file like this:
@example
(global-set-key "\C-c s" 'slime-selector)
@end example
@noindent
which binds @kbd{C-c s} to the function @code{slime-selector}.

Alternatively, if you want to assign or change a key binding in just a
particular slime mode, you can use the @code{define-key} function
in your @file{~/.emacs} file like this:
@example
(define-key slime-repl-mode-map (kbd "C-c ;") 
            'slime-insert-balanced-comments)
@end example
@noindent
which binds @kbd{C-c ;} to the function
@code{slime-insert-balanced-comments} in the REPL buffer.

@c ----------------------- 
@node Evaluation
@section Evaluation commands

These commands each evaluate a Common Lisp expression in a different
way.  Usually they mimic commands for evaluating Emacs Lisp code.  By
default they show their results in the echo area, but a prefix
argument causes the results to be inserted in the current buffer.

@table @kbd

@kbditem{C-x C-e, slime-eval-last-expression}

Evaluate the expression before point and show the result in the echo
area.

@kbditem{C-M-x, slime-eval-defun}
Evaluate the current toplevel form and show the result in the echo
area.  `C-M-x' treats `defvar' expressions specially.  Normally,
evaluating a `defvar' expression does nothing if the variable it
defines already has a value.  But `C-M-x' unconditionally resets the
variable to the initial value specified in the `defvar' expression.
This special feature is convenient for debugging Lisp programs.

@end table

If @kbd{C-M-x} or @kbd{C-x C-e} is given a numeric argument, it
inserts the value into the current buffer, rather than displaying it
in the echo area.

@table @kbd
@kbditem{C-c :, slime-interactive-eval}
Evaluate an expression read from the minibuffer.

@kbditem{C-c C-r, slime-eval-region}
Evaluate the region.

@kbditem{C-c C-p, slime-pprint-eval-last-expression}
Evaluate the expression before point and pretty-print the result in a
fresh buffer.

@kbditem{C-c E, slime-edit-value}
Edit the value of a setf-able form in a new buffer @file{*Edit <form>*}.
The value is inserted into a temporary buffer for editing and then set
in Lisp when committed with @kbd{C-c C-c}.

@kbditem{C-x M-e, slime-eval-last-expression-display-output}
Display the output buffer and evaluate the expression preceding point.
This is useful if the expression writes something to the output stream.

@kbditem{C-c C-u, slime-undefine-function}
Undefine the function, with @code{fmakunbound}, for the symbol at
point.

@end table

@c ----------------------- 
@node Compilation
@section Compilation commands

@cindex Compilation

@SLIME{} has fancy commands for compiling functions, files, and
packages. The fancy part is that notes and warnings offered by the
Lisp compiler are intercepted and annotated directly onto the
corresponding expressions in the Lisp source buffer. (Give it a try to
see what this means.)

@table @kbd
@cindex Compiling Functions
@kbditem{C-c C-c, slime-compile-defun}
Compile the top-level form at point.  The region blinks shortly to
give some feedback which part was chosen.

With (positive) prefix argument the form is compiled with maximal
debug settings (@kbd{C-u C-c C-c}). With negative prefix argument it is compiled for
speed (@kbd{M-- C-c C-c}). If a numeric argument is passed set debug or speed settings
to it depending on its sign.

The code for the region is executed after compilation.  In principle,
the command writes the region to a file, compiles that file, and loads
the resulting code.

@kbditem{C-c C-k, slime-compile-and-load-file}
Compile and load the current buffer's source file.  If the compilation
step fails, the file is not loaded.  It's not always easy to tell
whether the compilation failed: occasionally you may end up in the
debugger during the load step.

With (positive) prefix argument the file is compiled with maximal
debug settings (@kbd{C-u C-c C-k}). With negative prefix argument it is compiled for
speed (@kbd{M-- C-c C-k}). If a numeric argument is passed set debug or speed settings
to it depending on its sign.

@kbditem{C-c M-k, slime-compile-file}
Compile (but don't load) the current buffer's source file.

@kbditem{C-c C-l, slime-load-file}
Load a Lisp file.  This command uses the Common Lisp LOAD function.

@cmditem{slime-compile-region}
Compile the selected region.

@end table

The annotations are indicated as underlining on source forms. The
compiler message associated with an annotation can be read either by
placing the mouse over the text or with the selection commands below.

@table @kbd
@kbditem{M-n, slime-next-note}
Move the point to the next compiler note and displays the note.

@kbditem{M-p, slime-previous-note}
Move the point to the previous compiler note and displays the note.

@kbditem{C-c M-c, slime-remove-notes}
Remove all annotations from the buffer.

@kbditem{C-x `, next-error}
Visit the next-error message.  This is not actually a @SLIME{} command
but @SLIME{} creates a hidden buffer so that most of the Compilation
mode commands (@inforef{Compilation Mode,, emacs}) work similarly for
Lisp as for batch compilers.

@end table

@node Completion
@section Completion commands

@cindex Completion
@cindex Symbol Completion

Completion commands are used to complete a symbol or form based on
what is already present at point. Classical completion assumes an
exact prefix and gives choices only where branches may occur. Fuzzy
completion tries harder.

@table @kbd
@kbditem{M-TAB,slime-complete-symbol}
@c @itemx ESC TAB
@c @itemx C-M-i
Complete the symbol at point. Note that three styles of completion are
available in @SLIME{}; the default is similar to normal Emacs
completion (@pxref{slime-complete-symbol-function}).

@end table

@c ----------------------- 
@node Finding definitions
@section Finding definitions (``Meta-Point'' commands).

@cindex Meta-dot
@cindex TAGS

The familiar @kbd{M-.} command is provided. For generic functions this
command finds all methods, and with some systems it does other fancy
things (like tracing structure accessors to their @code{DEFSTRUCT}
definition).

@table @kbd

@kbditem{M-., slime-edit-definition}
Go to the definition of the symbol at point.

@item M-,
@itemx M-*
@itemx M-x slime-pop-find-definition-stack
@kindex M-,
@findex slime-pop-find-definition-stack
Go back to the point where @kbd{M-.} was invoked. This gives multi-level
backtracking when @kbd{M-.} has been used several times.

@kbditem{C-x 4 ., slime-edit-definition-other-window}
Like @code{slime-edit-definition} but switches to the other window to
edit the definition in.

@kbditem{C-x 5 ., slime-edit-definition-other-frame}
Like @code{slime-edit-definition} but opens another frame to edit the
definition in.

@cmditem{slime-edit-definition-with-etags}
Use an ETAGS table to find definition at point.

@end table

@c ----------------------- 
@node Documentation
@section Documentation commands

@SLIME{}'s online documentation commands follow the example of Emacs
Lisp. The commands all share the common prefix @kbd{C-c C-d} and allow
the final key to be modified or unmodified (@pxref{Key bindings}.)

@table @kbd

@kbditem{SPC, slime-space}
The space key inserts a space, but also looks up and displays the
argument list for the function at point, if there is one.

@kbditem{C-c C-d d, slime-describe-symbol}
Describe the symbol at point.

@kbditem{C-c C-d f, slime-describe-function}
Describe the function at point.

@kbditem{C-c C-d A, slime-apropos}
Perform an apropos search on Lisp symbol names for a regular expression
match and display their documentation strings. By default the external
symbols of all packages are searched. With a prefix argument you can choose a
specific package and whether to include unexported symbols.

@kbditem{C-c C-d z, slime-apropos-all}
Like @code{slime-apropos} but also includes internal symbols by default.

@kbditem{C-c C-d p, slime-apropos-package}
Show apropos results of all symbols in a package. This command is for
browsing a package at a high-level. With package-name completion it
also serves as a rudimentary Smalltalk-ish image-browser.

@kbditem{C-c C-d h, slime-hyperspec-lookup}
Lookup the symbol at point in the @cite{Common Lisp Hyperspec}. This
uses the familiar @file{hyperspec.el} to show the appropriate section
in a web browser. The Hyperspec is found either on the Web or in
@code{common-lisp-hyperspec-root}, and the browser is selected by
@code{browse-url-browser-function}.

Note: this is one case where @kbd{C-c C-d h} is @emph{not} the same as
@kbd{C-c C-d C-h}.

@kbditem{C-c C-d ~, hyperspec-lookup-format}
Lookup a @emph{format character} in the @cite{Common Lisp Hyperspec}.

@kbditem{C-c C-d #, hyperspec-lookup-reader-macro}
Lookup a @emph{reader macro} in the @cite{Common Lisp Hyperspec}.
@end table

@c ----------------------- 
@node Cross-reference
@section Cross-reference commands

@cindex xref
@cindex Cross-referencing

@SLIME{}'s cross-reference commands are based on the support provided
by the Lisp system, which varies widely between Lisps. For systems
with no built-in @acronym{XREF} support @SLIME{} queries a portable
@acronym{XREF} package, which is taken from the @cite{CMU AI
Repository} and bundled with @SLIME{}.

Each command operates on the symbol at point, or prompts if there is
none. With a prefix argument they always prompt. You can either enter
the key bindings as shown here or with the control modified on the
last key, @xref{Key bindings}.

@menu
* Xref buffer commands::
@end menu

@table @kbd
@kbditem{C-c C-w c, slime-who-calls}
Show function callers.

@kbditem{C-c C-w w, slime-calls-who}
Show all known callees.

@kbditem{C-c C-w r, slime-who-references}
Show references to global variable.

@kbditem{C-c C-w b, slime-who-binds}

@kbditem{C-c C-w s, slime-who-sets}
Show assignments to a global variable.

@kbditem{C-c C-w m, slime-who-macroexpands}
Show expansions of a macro.

@cmditem{slime-who-specializes}
Show all known methods specialized on a class.

@end table

There are also ``List callers/callees'' commands. These operate by
rummaging through function objects on the heap at a low-level to
discover the call graph. They are only available with some Lisp
systems, and are most useful as a fallback when precise @acronym{XREF}
information is unavailable.

@table @kbd
@kbditem{C-c <, slime-list-callers}
List callers of a function.

@kbditem{C-c >, slime-list-callees}
List callees of a function.

@end table

@section Macro-expansion commands

@cindex Macros

@table @kbd
@kbditem{C-c C-m, slime-macroexpand-1}
Macroexpand the expression at point once.  If invoked with a prefix
argument, use macroexpand instead of macroexpand-1.

@kbditem{C-c M-m, slime-macroexpand-all}
Fully macroexpand the expression at point.

@cmditem{slime-compiler-macroexpand-1}
Display the compiler-macro expansion of sexp at point.

should be traced.

@cmditem{slime-untrace-all}
Untrace all functions.

@end table

@node Recovery
@section Abort/Recovery commands

@table @kbd
@kbditem{C-c C-b, slime-interrupt}

@cmditem{slime-cd}
Set the current directory of the Lisp process.  This also
changes the current directory of the REPL buffer.

@cmditem{slime-pwd}
Print the current directory of the Lisp process.

@end table

@c ----------------------- 
@node Inspector
@section Inspector commands

The @SLIME{} inspector is a Emacs-based alternative to the
standard @code{INSPECT} function. The inspector presents objects in
Emacs buffers using a combination of plain text, hyperlinks to related
objects.

The inspector can easily be specialized for the objects in your own
programs. For details see the the @code{inspect-for-emacs} generic
function in @file{swank-backend.lisp}.

@table @kbd

@kbditem{C-c I, slime-inspect}
Inspect the value of an expression entered in the minibuffer.

@end table

The standard commands available in the inspector are:

@table @kbd

@kbditem{RET, slime-inspector-operate-on-point} 
If point is on a value then recursively call the inspector on that
value. If point is on an action then call that action.

@kbditem{d, slime-inspector-describe}
Describe the slot at point.

@kbditem{e, slime-inspector-eval}
Evaluate an expression in the context of the inspected object.

@kbditem{v, slime-inspector-toggle-verbose}
Toggle between verbose and terse mode. Default is determined by
`swank:*inspector-verbose*'.

@kbditem{l, slime-inspector-pop}

Dismiss the inspector buffer.

@kbditem{p, slime-inspector-pprint}
Pretty print in another buffer object at point.

@kbditem{., slime-inspector-show-source}

@kbditem{>, slime-inspector-fetch-all}
Fetch all inspector contents and go to the end.

@kbditem{M-RET, slime-inspector-copy-down}
Store the value under point in the variable `*'.  This can
then be used to access the object in the REPL.

@kbditempair{TAB, S-TAB, slime-inspector-next-inspectable-object,
slime-inspector-previous-inspectable-object}

Jump to the next and previous inspectable object respectively.

@end table

@c ----------------------- 
@node Profiling
@section Profiling commands

The profiling commands are based on CMUCL's profiler.  These are
simple wrappers around functions which usually print something to the
output buffer.

@table @kbd

@node Semantic indentation
@section Semantic indentation

@SLIME{} automatically discovers how to indent the macros in your Lisp
system. To do this the Lisp side scans all the macros in the system and
reports to Emacs all the ones with @code{&body} arguments. Emacs then
indents these specially, putting the first arguments four spaces in and
the ``body'' arguments just two spaces, as usual.

This should ``just work.'' If you are a lucky sort of person you needn't
read the rest of this section.

To simplify the implementation, @SLIME{} doesn't distinguish between
macros with the same symbol-name but different packages. This makes it
fit nicely with Emacs's indentation code. However, if you do have
several macros with the same symbol-name then they will all be indented
the same way, arbitrarily using the style from one of their
arglists. You can find out which symbols are involved in collisions
with:

@example
(swank:print-indentation-lossage)
@end example

If a collision causes you irritation, don't have a nervous breakdown,
just override the Elisp symbol's @code{common-lisp-indent-function}
property to your taste. @SLIME{} won't override your custom settings, it
just tries to give you good defaults.

A more subtle issue is that imperfect caching is used for the sake of
performance. @footnote{@emph{Of course} we made sure it was actually too
slow before making the ugly optimization.}

In an ideal world, Lisp would automatically scan every symbol for
indentation changes after each command from Emacs. However, this is too
expensive to do every time. Instead Lisp usually just scans the symbols
whose home package matches the one used by the Emacs buffer where the
request comes from. That is sufficient to pick up the indentation of
most interactively-defined macros. To catch the rest we make a full scan
of every symbol each time a new Lisp package is created between commands
-- that takes care of things like new systems being loaded.

You can use @kbd{M-x slime-update-indentation} to force all symbols to
be scanned for indentation information.

@c ----------------------- 
@node Reader conditionals
@section Reader conditional fontification

@SLIME{} automatically evaluates reader-conditional expressions, like
@code{#+linux}, in source buffers and ``grays out'' code that will be

@node Debugger
@chapter SLDB: the SLIME debugger

@cindex Debugger

@SLIME{} has a custom Emacs-based debugger called @SLDB{}. Conditions
signalled in the Lisp system invoke @SLDB{} in Emacs by way of the
Lisp @code{*DEBUGGER-HOOK*}.

@SLDB{} pops up a buffer when a condition is signalled. The buffer
displays a description of the condition, a list of restarts, and a
backtrace. Commands are offered for invoking restarts, examining the
backtrace, and poking around in stack frames.

@node slime-selector
@section @code{slime-selector}

The @code{slime-selector} command is for quickly switching to
important buffers: the @REPL{}, @SLDB{}, the Lisp source you were just
hacking, etc. Once invoked the command prompts for a single letter to
specify which buffer it should display. Here are some of the options:

@table @kbd
@item ?
A help buffer listing all @code{slime-selectors}'s available buffers.
@item r
The @REPL{} buffer for the current @SLIME{} connection.
@item d
The most recently activated @SLDB{} buffer for the current connection.
@item l
The most recently visited @code{lisp-mode} source buffer.
@item s
The @code{*slime-scratch*} buffer (@pxref{slime-scratch}).
@item c
SLIME connections buffer (@pxref{Multiple connections}).
@item n
Cycle to the next Lisp connection (@pxref{Multiple connections}).
@item t
SLIME threads buffer (@pxref{Multiple connections}).
@end table

@code{slime-selector} doesn't have a key binding by default but we
suggest that you assign it a global one. You can bind it to @kbd{C-c s}
like this:

@example
(global-set-key "\C-cs" 'slime-selector)
@end example

@noindent
And then you can switch to the @REPL{} from anywhere with @kbd{C-c s
r}.

The macro @code{def-slime-selector-method} can be used to define new
buffers for @code{slime-selector} to find.

@c ----------------------- 
@node slime-macroexpansion-minor-mode

@c ----------------------- 
@node Multiple connections
@section Multiple connections

@SLIME{} is able to connect to multiple Lisp processes at the same
time. The @kbd{M-x slime} command, when invoked with a prefix
argument, will offer to create an additional Lisp process if one is
already running. This is often convenient, but it requires some
understanding to make sure that your @SLIME{} commands execute in the
Lisp that you expect them to.

Some buffers are tied to specific Lisp processes. Each Lisp connection
has its own @acronym{REPL} buffer, and all expressions entered or
@SLIME{} commands invoked in that buffer are sent to the associated
connection. Other buffers created by @SLIME{} are similarly tied to
the connections they originate from, including @SLDB{} buffers,
apropos result listings, and so on. These buffers are the result of
some interaction with a Lisp process, so commands in them always go
back to that same process.

Commands executed in other places, such as @code{slime-mode} source
buffers, always use the ``default'' connection. Usually this is the
most recently established connection, but this can be reassigned via
the ``connection list'' buffer:

@table @kbd
@kbditem{C-c C-x c, slime-list-connections}
Pop up a buffer listing the established connections.  It is also
available by the typing @kbd{c} from the SLIME selector
(@ref{slime-selector}).

@kbditem{C-c C-x n, slime-cycle-connections}
Change current Lisp connection by cycling through all connections.  It
is also available by the typing @kbd{n} from the SLIME selector
(@ref{slime-selector}).

@kbditem{C-c C-x t, slime-list-threads}
Pop up a buffer listing the current threads.  It is also available by
the typing @kbd{t} from the SLIME selector (@ref{slime-selector}).
@end table

The buffer displayed by @code{slime-list-connections} gives a one-line
summary of each connection. The summary shows the connection's serial
number, the name of the Lisp implementation, and other details of the
Lisp process. The current ``default'' connection is indicated with an
asterisk.

The commands available in the connection-list buffer are:

@table @kbd
@kbditem{RET, slime-goto-connection}
Pop to the @acronym{REPL} buffer of the connection at point.

@kbditem{d, slime-connection-list-make-default}
Make the connection at point the ``default'' connection. It will then
be used for commands in @code{slime-mode} source buffers.

@kbditem{g, slime-update-connection-list}
Update the connection list in the buffer.

@kbditem{q, slime-temp-buffer-quit}
Quit the connection list (kill buffer, restore window configuration).

@kbditem{R, slime-restart-connection-at-point}
Restart the Lisp process for the connection at point.

@cmditem{slime-connect}
Connect to a running Swank server.

@cmditem{slime-disconnect}
Disconnect all connections.

@cmditem{slime-abort-connection}
Abort the current attempt to connect.

@section Emacs-side

The Emacs part of @SLIME{} can be configured with the Emacs
@code{customize} system, just use @kbd{M-x customize-group slime
RET}. Because the customize system is self-describing, we only cover a
few important or obscure configuration options here in the manual.

@table @code

@item slime-truncate-lines
The value to use for @code{truncate-lines} in line-by-line summary
buffers popped up by @SLIME{}. This is @code{t} by default, which
ensures that lines do not wrap in backtraces, apropos listings, and so
on. It can however cause information to spill off the screen.

@anchor{slime-complete-symbol-function}
@vindex slime-complete-symbol-function
@item slime-complete-symbol-function
The function to use for completion of Lisp symbols. Three completion
styles are available: @code{slime-simple-complete-symbol},
@code{slime-complete-symbol*} (@pxref{Compound Completion}), 
and @code{slime-fuzzy-complete-symbol} (@pxref{Fuzzy Completion}).

The default is @code{slime-simple-complete-symbol}, which completes in
the usual Emacs way.

@vindex slime-filename-translations
@item slime-filename-translations
This variable controls filename translation between Emacs and the Lisp
system. It is useful if you run Emacs and Lisp on separate machines
which don't share a common file system or if they share the filesystem
but have different layouts, as is the case with @acronym{SMB}-based
file sharing.

@cindex UTF-8
@cindex ASCII
@cindex LATIN-1
@cindex Character Encoding
@item slime-net-coding-system
If you want to transmit Unicode characters between Emacs and the Lisp
system, you should customize this variable.  E.g., if you use SBCL, you
can set:
@example
(setq slime-net-coding-system 'utf-8-unix)
@end example
To actually display Unicode characters you also need appropriate
fonts, otherwise the characters will be rendered as hollow boxes.  If
you are using Allegro CL and GNU Emacs, you can also
use @code{emacs-mule-unix} as coding system.  GNU Emacs has often
nicer fonts for the latter encoding.  (Different encodings can be used 
for different Lisps, see @ref{Multiple Lisps}.)

@item sldb-hook
This hook is run after @SLDB{} is invoked. The hook functions are
called from the @SLDB{} buffer after it is initialized. An example use
is to add @code{sldb-print-condition} to this hook, which makes all
conditions debugged with @SLDB{} be recorded in the @REPL{} buffer.

@section Lisp-side (Swank)

The Lisp server side of @SLIME{} (known as ``Swank'') offers several
variables to configure. The initialization file @file{~/.swank.lisp}
is automatically evaluated at startup and can be used to set these
variables.

@menu
* Communication style::         
* Other configurables::         
@end menu

@c ----------------------- 
@node Communication style
@subsection Communication style
@vindex SWANK:*COMMUNICATION-STYLE*

The most important configurable is @code{SWANK:*COMMUNICATION-STYLE*},
which specifies the mechanism by which Lisp reads and processes
protocol messages from Emacs. The choice of communication style has a
global influence on @SLIME{}'s operation.

The available communication styles are:

@table @code
@item NIL
This style simply loops reading input from the communication socket
and serves @SLIME{} protocol events as they arise. The simplicity
means that the Lisp cannot do any other processing while under
@SLIME{}'s control.

@item :FD-HANDLER
This style uses the classical Unix-style ``@code{select()}-loop.''
Swank registers the communication socket with an event-dispatching
framework (such as @code{SERVE-EVENT} in @acronym{CMUCL} and
@acronym{SBCL}) and receives a callback when data is available. In
this style requests from Emacs are only detected and processed when
Lisp enters the event-loop. This style is simple and predictable.

@item :SIGIO
This style uses @dfn{signal-driven I/O} with a @code{SIGIO} signal
handler. Lisp receives requests from Emacs along with a signal,
causing it to interrupt whatever it is doing to serve the
request. This style has the advantage of responsiveness, since Emacs
can perform operations in Lisp even while it is busy doing other
things. It also allows Emacs to issue requests concurrently, e.g. to
send one long-running request (like compilation) and then interrupt
that with several short requests before it completes. The
disadvantages are that it may conflict with other uses of @code{SIGIO}
by Lisp code, and it may cause untold havoc by interrupting Lisp at an
awkward moment.

@item :SPAWN
This style uses multiprocessing support in the Lisp system to execute
each request in a separate thread. This style has similar properties
to @code{:SIGIO}, but it does not use signals and all requests issued
by Emacs can be executed in parallel.

@end table

The default request handling style is chosen according to the
capabilities of your Lisp system. The general order of preference is
@code{:SPAWN}, then @code{:SIGIO}, then @code{:FD-HANDLER}, with
@code{NIL} as a last resort. You can check the default style by
calling @code{SWANK-BACKEND::PREFERRED-COMMUNICATION-STYLE}. You can
also override the default by setting
@code{SWANK:*COMMUNICATION-STYLE*} in your Swank init file.

@c ----------------------- 
@node Other configurables
@subsection Other configurables

These Lisp variables can be configured via your @file{~/.swank.lisp}
file:

@table @code

@vindex SWANK:*CONFIGURE-EMACS-INDENTATION*
@item SWANK:*CONFIGURE-EMACS-INDENTATION*
This variable controls whether indentation styles for
@code{&body}-arguments in macros are discovered and sent to Emacs. It
is enabled by default.

@vindex SWANK:*GLOBALLY-REDIRECT-IO*
@item SWANK:*GLOBALLY-REDIRECT-IO*
When true this causes the standard streams (@code{*standard-output*},
etc) to be globally redirected to the @REPL{} in Emacs. When
@code{NIL} (the default) these streams are only temporarily redirected
to Emacs using dynamic bindings while handling requests. Note that
@code{*standard-input*} is currently never globally redirected into
Emacs, because it can interact badly with the Lisp's native @REPL{} by
having it try to read from the Emacs one.

@vindex SWANK:*GLOBAL-DEBUGGER*
@item SWANK:*GLOBAL-DEBUGGER*
When true (the default) this causes @code{*DEBUGGER-HOOK*} to be
globally set to @code{SWANK:SWANK-DEBUGGER-HOOK} and thus for @SLIME{}
to handle all debugging in the Lisp image. This is for debugging
multithreaded and callback-driven applications.

@anchor{SWANK:*SLDB-QUIT-RESTART*}
@vindex SWANK:*SLDB-QUIT-RESTART*
@item SWANK:*SLDB-QUIT-RESTART*
This variable names the restart that is invoked when pressing @kbd{q}
(@pxref{sldb-quit}) in @SLDB{}. For @SLIME{} evaluation requests this
is @emph{unconditionally} bound to a restart that returns to a safe
point. This variable is supposed to customize what @kbd{q} does if an
application's thread lands into the debugger (see
@code{SWANK:*GLOBAL-DEBUGGER*}).
@example
(setf swank:*sldb-quit-restart* 'sb-thread:terminate-thread)
@end example

@vindex SWANK:*BACKTRACE-PRINTER-BINDINGS*
@vindex SWANK:*MACROEXPAND-PRINTER-BINDINGS*
@vindex SWANK:*SLDB-PRINTER-BINDINGS*
@vindex SWANK:*SWANK-PPRINT-BINDINGS*
@item SWANK:*BACKTRACE-PRINTER-BINDINGS*
@itemx SWANK:*MACROEXPAND-PRINTER-BINDINGS*
@itemx SWANK:*SLDB-PRINTER-BINDINGS*
@itemx SWANK:*SWANK-PPRINT-BINDINGS*
These variables can be used to customize the printer in various
situations.  The values of the variables are association lists of
printer variable names with the corresponding value.  E.g., to enable
the pretty printer for formatting backtraces in @SLDB{}, you can use:
@example
(push '(*print-pretty* . t) swank:*sldb-printer-bindings*).
@end example

@vindex SWANK:*USE-DEDICATED-OUTPUT-STREAM*
@item SWANK:*USE-DEDICATED-OUTPUT-STREAM*
This variable controls whether to use an unsafe efficiency hack for
sending printed output from Lisp to Emacs.  The default is @code{nil},
don't use it, and is strongly recommended to keep.

When @code{t}, a separate socket is established solely for Lisp to send
printed output to Emacs through, which is faster than sending the output
in protocol-messages to Emacs.  However, as nothing can be guaranteed
about the timing between the dedicated output stream and the stream of
protocol messages, the output of a Lisp command can arrive before or
after the corresponding REPL results.  Thus output and REPL results can
end up in the wrong order, or even interleaved, in the REPL buffer.
Using a dedicated output stream also makes it more difficult to
communicate to a Lisp running on a remote host via SSH
(@pxref{Connecting to a remote lisp}).  

@vindex SWANK:*DEDICATED-OUTPUT-STREAM-PORT*
@item SWANK:*DEDICATED-OUTPUT-STREAM-PORT*
When @code{*USE-DEDICATED-OUTPUT-STREAM*} is @code{t} the stream will
be opened on this port. The default value, @code{0}, means that the
stream will be opened on some random port.

@vindex SWANK:*LOG-EVENTS*
@item SWANK:*LOG-EVENTS*
Setting this variable to @code{t} causes all protocol messages
exchanged with Emacs to be printed to @code{*TERMINAL-IO*}. This is
useful for low-level debugging and for observing how @SLIME{} works
``on the wire.'' The output of @code{*TERMINAL-IO*} can be found in
your Lisp system's own listener, usually in the buffer
@code{*inferior-lisp*}.

@section Connecting to a remote lisp

One of the advantages of the way @SLIME{} is implemented is that we
can easily run the Emacs side (slime.el) on one machine and the lisp
backend (swank) on another. The basic idea is to start up lisp on the
remote machine, load swank and wait for incoming slime connections. On
the local machine we start up emacs and tell slime to connect to the
remote machine. The details are a bit messier but the underlying idea
is that simple.

* Setting up pathname translations::  
@end menu

@c ----------------------- 
@node Setting up the lisp image
@subsection Setting up the lisp image

When you want to load swank without going through the normal, Emacs
based, process just load the @file{swank-loader.lisp} file. Just
execute

@example
(load "/path/to/swank-loader.lisp")
(swank-loader:init)
@end example

inside a running lisp image@footnote{@SLIME{} also provides an
@acronym{ASDF} system definition which does the same thing}. Now all we
need to do is startup our swank server. The first example assumes we're
using the default settings.

@example
(swank:create-server)
@end example

Since we're going to be tunneling our connection via
ssh@footnote{there is a way to connect without an ssh tunnel, but it
has the side-effect of giving the entire world access to your lisp
image, so we're not going to talk about it} and we'll only have one
port open we want to tell swank to not use an extra connection for
output (this is actually the default in current SLIME):

@example
(setf swank:*use-dedicated-output-stream* nil)
@end example

@c ----------------------- 
If you need to do anything particular
(like be able to reconnect to swank after you're done), look into
@code{swank:create-server}'s other arguments. Some of these arguments
are
@table @code

@item :PORT
Port number for the server to listen on (default: 4005).
@item :STYLE
See @xref{Communication style}.
@item :DONT-CLOSE
Boolean indicating if the server will continue to accept connections
after the first one (default: @code{NIL}). For ``long-running'' lisp processes
to which you want to be able to connect from time to time,
specify @code{:dont-close t}
@item :CODING-SYSTEM
String designating the encoding to be used to communicate between the
Emacs and Lisp.
@end table

So the more complete example will be
@example
(swank:create-server :port 4005  :dont-close t :coding-system "utf-8-unix")
@end example
On the emacs side you will use something like
@example
(setq slime-net-coding-system 'utf-8-unix)
(slime-connect "127.0.0.1" 4005))
@end example
to connect to this lisp image from the same machine.


@node Setting up Emacs
@subsection Setting up Emacs

Now we need to create the tunnel between the local machine and the
remote machine.

@example
ssh -L4005:127.0.0.1:4005 username@@remote.example.com
@end example

That ssh invocation creates an ssh tunnel between the port 4005 on our
local machine and the port 4005 on the remote machine@footnote{By
default swank listens for incoming connections on port 4005, had we
passed a @code{:port} parameter to @code{swank:create-server} we'd be
using that port number instead}. 

Finally we can start @SLIME{}:

@example
M-x slime-connect RET RET
@end example

The @kbd{RET RET} sequence just means that we want to use the default
host (@code{127.0.0.1}) and the default port (@code{4005}). Even
though we're connecting to a remote machine the ssh tunnel fools Emacs
into thinking it's actually @code{127.0.0.1}.

@c ----------------------- 
@node Setting up pathname translations
@subsection Setting up pathname translations

One of the main problems with running swank remotely is that Emacs
assumes the files can be found using normal filenames. if we want
things like @code{slime-compile-and-load-file} (@kbd{C-c C-k}) and
@code{slime-edit-definition} (@kbd{M-.}) to work correctly we need to
find a way to let our local Emacs refer to remote files.

There are, mainly, two ways to do this. The first is to mount, using
NFS or similar, the remote machine's hard disk on the local machine's
file system in such a fashion that a filename like
@file{/opt/project/source.lisp} refers to the same file on both
machines. Unfortunately NFS is usually slow, often buggy, and not
always feasible, fortunately we have an ssh connection and Emacs'
@code{tramp-mode} can do the rest. 
(See @inforef{Top, TRAMP User Manual,tramp}.)

What we do is teach Emacs how to take a filename on the remote machine
and translate it into something that tramp can understand and access
(and vice versa). Assuming the remote machine's host name is
@code{remote.example.com}, @code{cl:machine-instance} returns
``remote'' and we login as the user ``user'' we can use @code{slime-tramp}
contrib to setup the proper translations by simply doing:

@example
(push (slime-create-filename-translator :machine-instance "remote"
                                        :remote-host "remote.example.com"
                                        :username "user")
      slime-filename-translations)
@end example

@c ----------------------- 
@node Global IO Redirection
@section Globally redirecting all IO to the REPL

By default @SLIME{} does not change @code{*standard-output*} and
friends outside of the @REPL{}. If you have any other threads which
call @code{format}, @code{write-string}, etc. that output will be seen
only in the @code{*inferior-lisp*} buffer or on the terminal, more
often than not this is inconvenient. So, if you want code such as this:

@example
(run-in-new-thread
  (lambda ()
    (write-line "In some random thread.~%" *standard-output*)))
@end example

to send its output to @SLIME{}'s repl buffer, as opposed to
@code{*inferior-lisp*}, set @code{swank:*globally-redirect-io*} to T.

Note that the value of this variable is only checked when swank
accepts the connection so you should set it via
@file{~/.swank.lisp}. Otherwise you will need to call
@code{swank::globally-redirect-io-to-connection} yourself, but you
shouldn't do that unless you know what you're doing.

@c ----------------------- 
@node Auto-SLIME
@section Connecting to SLIME automatically

To make @SLIME{} connect to your lisp whenever you open a lisp file
just add this to your @file{.emacs}:

@example
(add-hook 'slime-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (unless (slime-connected-p)
              (save-excursion (slime)))))

@node Loading Contribs
@section Loading Contrib Packages

@cindex Contribs
@cindex Contributions
@cindex Plugins

Contrib packages aren't loaded by default.  You have to modify your
setup a bit so that Emacs knows where to find them and which of them
to load.  Generally, you should call @code{slime-setup} with the list
of package-names that you want to use.  For example, a setup to load
the @code{slime-scratch} and @code{slime-editing-commands} packages
looks like:

@example
(setq inferior-lisp-program "/opt/sbcl/bin/sbcl") ; @emph{your Lisp system}
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/hacking/lisp/slime/")  ; @emph{your SLIME directory}
(require 'slime-autoloads)
(slime-setup '(slime-scratch slime-editing-commands))
@end example

After starting SLIME, the commands of both packages should be
available.

The REPL and @code{slime-fancy} modules deserve special mention.  Many
users consider the REPL (@pxref{REPL}) essential
while @code{slime-fancy} (@pxref{slime-fancy}) loads the REPL and
almost all of the popular contribs.  So, if you aren't sure what to
choose start with:

@example
(slime-setup '(slime-repl)) ; repl only
@end example

If you like what you see try this:

@example
(slime-setup '(slime-fancy)) ; almost everything

@node REPL
@section REPL: the ``top level''

@cindex Listener

@SLIME{} uses a custom Read-Eval-Print Loop (@REPL{}, also known as a
``top level'', or listener). The @REPL{} user-interface is written in
Emacs Lisp, which gives more Emacs-integration than the traditional
@code{comint}-based Lisp interaction:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Conditions signalled in @REPL{} expressions are debugged with @SLDB{}.
@item
Return values are distinguished from printed output by separate Emacs
faces (colours).
@item
Emacs manages the @REPL{} prompt with markers. This ensures that Lisp
output is inserted in the right place, and doesn't get mixed up with
user input.
@end itemize

To load the REPL call @code{(slime-setup '(slime-repl))} in your
@code{.emacs}.

@table @kbd

@kbditem{C-c C-z, slime-switch-to-output-buffer}
Select the output buffer, preferably in a different window.

@kbditem{C-c C-y, slime-call-defun}
Insert a call to the function defined around point into the REPL.

@kbditem{C-c C-j, slime-eval-last-expression-in-repl}

@cindex Input History

The input navigation (a.k.a. history) commands are modelled after
@code{coming}-mode.  Be careful if you are used to Bash-like
keybindings: @kbd{M-p} and @kbd{M-n} use the current input as search
pattern and only work Bash-like if the current line is
empty. @kbd{C-<up>} and @kbd{C-<up>} work like the up and down keys in
Bash.

@table @kbd

@kbditempair{C-<up>, C-<down>,
             slime-repl-forward-input, slime-repl-backward-input}
Go to the next/previous history item.

@kbditempair{M-n, M-p, slime-repl-next-input, slime-repl-previous-input}
Search the next/previous item in the command history using the current
input as search pattern.  If @kbd{M-n}/@kbd{M-n} is typed two times in
a row, the second invocation uses the same search pattern (even if the
current input has changed).

@kbditempair{M-s, M-r,
slime-repl-next-matching-input, slime-repl-previous-matching-input}
Search forward/reverse through command history with regex

@c @code{slime-repl-@{next,previous@}-input}@*
@c @code{slime-repl-@{next,previous@}-matching-input}@*
@c @code{comint}-style input history commands.

@kbditempair{C-c C-n, C-c C-p, 
slime-repl-next-prompt, slime-repl-previous-prompt} 
Move between the current and previous prompts in the @REPL{} buffer.
Pressing RET on a line with old input copies that line to the newest
prompt.

@item change-package (aka !p, in, in-package)
Change the current package.

@item compile-and-load (aka cl)
Compile (if necessary) and load a lisp file.

@item defparameter (aka !)
Define a new global, special, variable.

@item disconnect
Disconnect all connections.

@item help (aka ?)
Display the help.

@item pop-directory (aka -d)
Pop the current directory.

@item pop-package (aka -p)
Pop the top of the package stack.

@item push-directory (aka +d, pushd)
Push a new directory onto the directory stack.

@item push-package (aka +p)
Push a package onto the package stack.

@item pwd
Show the current directory.

@item quit

@end table

@node slime-mrepl
@section Multiple REPLs

The @code{slime-mrepl} package adds support for multiple listener
buffers.  The command @kbd{M-x slime-open-listener} creates a new
buffer.  In a multi-threaded Lisp, each listener is associated with a
separate thread.  In a single-threaded Lisp it's also possible to
create multiple listener buffers but the commands are executed
sequentially by the same process.

@node inferior-slime-mode
@section @code{inferior-slime-mode}

The @code{inferior-slime-mode} is a minor mode is intended to use with
the @code{*inferior-lisp*} lisp buffer.  It provides some of the
SLIME commands, like symbol completion and documentation lookup. It
also tracks the current directory of the Lisp process.
To install it, add something like this to user @file{.emacs}:

@example
(slime-setup '(inferior-slime))
@end example

@table @kbd
@cmditem{inferior-slime-mode}
Turns inferior-slime-mode on or off.
@end table

@vindex inferior-slime-mode-map
The variable @code{inferior-slime-mode-map} contains the extra
keybindings.

@node Compound Completion
@section Compound Completion 

@anchor{slime-complete-symbol*}
The package @code{slime-c-p-c} provides a different symbol completion
algorithm, which performs completion ``in parallel'' over the
hyphen-delimited sub-words of a symbol name.
@footnote{This style of completion is modelled on @file{completer.el}
by Chris McConnell. That package is bundled with @acronym{ILISP}.}
Formally this means that ``@code{a-b-c}'' can complete to any symbol
matching the regular expression ``@code{^a.*-b.*-c.*}'' (where ``dot''
matches anything but a hyphen). Examples give a more intuitive
feeling:
@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{m-v-b} completes to @code{multiple-value-bind}.
@item
@code{w-open} is ambiguous: it completes to either
@code{with-open-file} or @code{with-open-stream}. The symbol is
expanded to the longest common completion (@code{with-open-}) and the
point is placed at the first point of ambiguity, which in this case is
the end.
@item
@code{w--stream} completes to @code{with-open-stream}.
@end itemize

The variable @code{slime-c-p-c-unambiguous-prefix-p} specifies where
point should be placed after completion.  E.g. the possible
completions for @code{f-o} are @code{finish-output} and
@code{force-output}.  By the default point is moved after the
@code{f}, because that is the unambiguous prefix.  If
@code{slime-c-p-c-unambiguous-prefix-p} is nil, point moves to
the end of the inserted text, after the @code{o} in this case.

In addition, @code{slime-c-p-c} provides completion for character names
(mostly useful for Unicode-aware implementations):

@example
CL-USER> #\Sp<TAB>
@end example

Here SLIME will usually complete the character to @code{#\Space}, but
in a Unicode-aware implementation, this might provide the following completions:
@example
Space                              Space
Sparkle                            Spherical_Angle
Spherical_Angle_Opening_Left       Spherical_Angle_Opening_Up
@end example

The package @code{slime-c-p-c} also provides context-sensitive completion for keywords.
Example:  

@example
CL-USER> (find 1 '(1 2 3) :s<TAB>
@end example

Here SLIME will complete @code{:start}, rather than suggesting all
ever-interned keywords starting with @code{:s}. 


@table @kbd
@kbditem{C-c C-s, slime-complete-form} 
Looks up and inserts into the current buffer the argument list for the
function at point, if there is one.  More generally, the command
completes an incomplete form with a template for the missing arguments.
There is special code for discovering extra keywords of generic
functions and for handling @code{make-instance},
@code{defmethod}, and many other functions. Examples:

@example
(subseq "abc" <C-c C-s>
  --inserts--> start [end])
(find 17 <C-c C-s>
  --inserts--> sequence :from-end from-end :test test
               :test-not test-not :start start :end end 
               :key key)
(find 17 '(17 18 19) :test #'= <C-c C-s>
  --inserts--> :from-end from-end
               :test-not test-not :start start :end end 
               :key key)
(defclass foo () ((bar :initarg :bar)))
(defmethod print-object <C-c C-s>
  --inserts-->   (object stream)
               body...)
(defmethod initialize-instance :after ((object foo) &key blub))
(make-instance 'foo <C-c C-s>
  --inserts--> :bar bar :blub blub initargs...)
@end example
@end table

@node Fuzzy Completion
@section Fuzzy Completion

The package @code{slime-fuzzy} implements yet another symbol
completion heuristic.

[Somebody please describe what the algorithm actually does]

It attempts to complete a symbol all at once, instead of in pieces.
For example, ``mvb'' will find ``@code{multiple-value-bind}'' and
``norm-df'' will find
``@code{least-positive-normalized-double-float}''.

The algorithm tries to expand every character in various ways and
rates the list of possible completions with the following heuristic.

Letters are given scores based on their position in the string.
Letters at the beginning of a string or after a prefix letter at
the beginning of a string are scored highest.  Letters after a
word separator such as #\- are scored next highest.  Letters at
the end of a string or before a suffix letter at the end of a
string are scored medium, and letters anywhere else are scored
low.

If a letter is directly after another matched letter, and its
intrinsic value in that position is less than a percentage of the
previous letter's value, it will use that percentage instead.

Finally, a small scaling factor is applied to favor shorter
matches, all other things being equal.

@table @kbd
@anchor{slime-fuzzy-complete-symbol}
@kbditem{C-c M-i, slime-fuzzy-complete-symbol}
Presents a list of likely completions to choose from for an
abbreviation at point.  If you set the
variable @code{slime-complete-symbol-function} to this command, fuzzy
completion will also be used for @kbd{M-TAB}.
@end table

@node slime-autodoc-mode
@section @code{slime-autodoc-mode}

Autodoc mode is an additional minor-mode for automatically showing
information about symbols near the point. For function names the
argument list is displayed, and for global variables, the value. 
Autodoc is implemented by means of @code{eldoc-mode} of Emacs.

The mode can be enabled by default in the @code{slime-setup} call of your
@code{~/.emacs}:
@example
(slime-setup '(slime-autodoc))
@end example

@table @kbd
@cmditem{slime-arglist NAME}
Show the argument list of the function NAME.

@cmditem{slime-autodoc-mode}
Toggles autodoc-mode on or off according to the argument, and
toggles the mode when invoked without argument.
@kbditem{C-c C-d a, slime-autodoc-manually}
Like slime-autodoc, but when called twice,
or after slime-autodoc was already automatically called, 
display multiline arglist.
@end table

@vindex slime-use-autodoc-mode
If the variable @code{slime-use-autodoc-mode} is set (default), Emacs
starts a timer, otherwise the information is only displayed after
pressing SPC.

@vindex slime-autodoc-use-multiline-p
If @code{slime-autodoc-use-multiline-p} is set to non-nil,
allow long autodoc messages to resize echo area display.

@node ASDF
@section ASDF

@acronym{ASDF} is a popular ``system construction tool''.  The package
@code{slime-asdf} provides some commands to load and compile such
systems from Emacs.  @acronym{ASDF} itself is not included with
@SLIME{}; you have to load that yourself into your Lisp.  In
particular, you must load @acronym{ASDF} before you connect, otherwise
you will get errors about missing symbols.

@table @kbd
@cmditem{slime-load-system NAME}
Compile and load an ASDF system.  The default system name is taken
from the first file matching *.asd in the current directory.
@cmditem{slime-reload-system NAME}
Recompile and load an ASDF system without recompiling its dependencies.
@cmditem{slime-open-system NAME &optional LOAD}
Open all files in a system, optionally load it if LOAD is non-nil.
@cmditem{slime-browse-system NAME}
Browse files in a system using Dired.
@cmditem{slime-delete-system-fasls NAME}
Delete FASLs produced by compiling a system.
@cmditem{slime-rgrep-system NAME REGEXP}
Run @code{rgrep} on the base directory of an ASDF system.
@cmditem{slime-isearch-system NAME}
Run @code{isearch-forward} on the files of an ASDF system.
@cmditem{slime-query-replace-system NAME FROM TO &OPTIONAL DELIMITED}
Run @code{query-replace} on an ASDF system.
@end table
The package also installs some new REPL shortcuts (@pxref{Shortcuts}):

@table @kbd
@item load-system
Compile (as needed) and load an ASDF system.
@item reload-system
Recompile and load an ASDF system.
@item compile-system
Compile (but not load) an ASDF system.
@item force-compile-system
Recompile (but not load) an ASDF system.
@item force-load-system
Recompile and load an ASDF system.
@item open-system
Open all files in a system.
@item browse-system
Browse files in a system using Dired.
@item delete-system-fasls
Delete FASLs produced by compiling a system.
@end table

@node Banner
@section Banner
The package @code{slime-banner} installs a window header line (
@inforef{Header Lines, , elisp}.) in the REPL buffer.  It also runs an
animation at startup.

@vindex slime-startup-animation
@vindex slime-header-line-p
By setting the variable @code{slime-startup-animation} to nil you can
disable the animation respectively with the
variable @code{slime-header-line-p} the header line.

@node Editing Commands
@section Editing Commands

The package @code{slime-editing-commands} provides some commands to
edit Lisp expressions.

@table @kbd
@kbditem{C-c M-q, slime-reindent-defun}
Re-indents the current defun, or refills the current paragraph.
If point is inside a comment block, the text around point will be
treated as a paragraph and will be filled with @code{fill-paragraph}.
Otherwise, it will be treated as Lisp code, and the current defun
will be reindented.  If the current defun has unbalanced parens,
an attempt will be made to fix it before reindenting.

@kbditem{C-c C-], slime-close-all-parens-in-sexp}
Balance parentheses of open s-expressions at point.
Insert enough right parentheses to balance unmatched left parentheses.
Delete extra left parentheses.  Reformat trailing parentheses 
Lisp-stylishly.

If REGION is true, operate on the region. Otherwise operate on
the top-level sexp before point.

@cmditem{slime-insert-balanced-comments}
Insert a set of balanced comments around the s-expression containing
the point.  If this command is invoked repeatedly (without any other
command occurring between invocations), the comment progressively
moves outward over enclosing expressions.  If invoked with a positive
prefix argument, the s-expression arg expressions out is enclosed in a
set of balanced comments.

@kbditem{M-C-a, slime-beginning-of-defun}
@kbditem{M-C-e, slime-end-of-defun}
@end table

@node Fancy Inspector
@section Fancy Inspector 

@cindex Methods

An alternative to default inspector is provided by the package
`slime-fancy-inspector'.  This inspector knows a lot about CLOS
objects and methods.  It provides many ``actions'' that can be
selected to invoke Lisp code on the inspected object. For example, to
present a generic function the inspector shows the documentation in
plain text and presents each method with both a hyperlink to inspect
the method object and a ``remove method'' action that you can invoke
interactively.  The key-bindings are the same as for the basic
inspector (@pxref{Inspector}).

@node Presentations
@section Presentations

@cindex Presentations

A ``presentation''@footnote{Presentations are a feature originating
from the Lisp machines.  It was possible to define @code{present}
methods specialized to various devices, e.g. to draw an object to
bitmapped screen or to write some text to a character stream.} in
@SLIME{} is a region of text associated with a Lisp object.
Right-clicking on the text brings up a menu with operations for the
particular object.  Some operations, like inspecting, are available
for all objects, but the object may also have specialized operations.
For instance, pathnames have a dired operation.

More importantly, it is possible to cut and paste presentations (i.e.,
Lisp objects, not just their printed presentation), using all standard
Emacs commands.  This way it is possible to cut and paste the results of
previous computations in the REPL.  This is of particular importance for
unreadable objects.

The package @code{slime-presentations} installs presentations in the
REPL, i.e. the results of evaluation commands become presentations.  In
this way, presentations generalize the use of the standard Common Lisp
REPL history variables @code{*}, @code{**}, @code{***}.  Example:

@example
CL-USER> (find-class 'standard-class)
@emph{#<STANDARD-CLASS STANDARD-CLASS>}
CL-USER>
@end example

Presentations appear in red color in the buffer.  
(In this manual, we indicate the presentations @emph{like this}.)
Using standard Emacs
commands, the presentation can be copied to a new input in the REPL:

@example
CL-USER> (eql '@emph{#<STANDARD-CLASS STANDARD-CLASS>} 
              '@emph{#<STANDARD-CLASS STANDARD-CLASS>})
@emph{T}
@end example

Note that standard evaluation and quoting rules still apply.  So if a
presentation is a list, it needs to be quoted in an evaluated context to
avoid treating it as a function call:

@example
CL-USER> (list (find-class 'standard-class) 2 3 4)
@emph{(#<STANDARD-CLASS STANDARD-CLASS> 2 3 4)}
CL-USER> @emph{(#<STANDARD-CLASS STANDARD-CLASS> 2 3 4)}
; Funcall of #<STANDARD-CLASS STANDARD-CLASS> which is a non-function.
; Evaluation aborted.
CL-USER> '@emph{(#<STANDARD-CLASS STANDARD-CLASS> 2 3 4)}
(#<STANDARD-CLASS STANDARD-CLASS> 2 3 4)
@end example

When you copy an incomplete presentation or edit the text within a
presentation, the presentation changes to plain text, losing the
association with a Lisp object.  In the buffer, this is indicated by
changing the color of the text from red to black.  This can be undone.

Presentations are also available in the inspector (all inspectable parts
are presentations) and the debugger (all local variables are
presentations).  This makes it possible to evaluate expressions in the
REPL using objects that appear in local variables of some active
debugger frame; this can be more convenient than using @code{M-x
sldb-eval-in-frame}.  @strong{Warning:} The presentations that stem from
the inspector and debugger are only valid as long as the corresponding
buffers are open.  Using them later can cause errors or confusing
behavior.

For some Lisp implementations you can also install the package
@code{slime-presentation-streams}, which enables presentations on the
Lisp @code{*standard-output*} stream and similar streams.  This means
that not only results 
of computations, but also some objects that are printed to the standard
output (as a side-effect of the computation) are associated with
presentations.  Currently, all unreadable objects
and pathnames get printed as presentations.

@example
CL-USER> (describe (find-class 'standard-object))
@emph{#<STANDARD-CLASS STANDARD-OBJECT>} is an instance of
    @emph{#<STANDARD-CLASS STANDARD-CLASS>}:
 The following slots have :INSTANCE allocation:
  PLIST                   NIL
  FLAGS                   1
  DIRECT-METHODS          ((@emph{#<STANDARD-METHOD
                              SWANK::ALL-SLOTS-FOR-INSPECTOR
                              (STANDARD-OBJECT T)>}
  ...
@end example

Again, this makes it possible to inspect and copy-paste these objects.

In addition to the standard Emacs commands, there are several keyboard
commands, a menu-bar menu, and a context menu to operate on
presentations.  We describe the keyboard commands below; they are also
shown in the menu-bar menu.

@table @kbd
@kbditem{C-c C-v SPC, slime-mark-presentation}
If point is within a presentation, move point to the beginning of the
presentation and mark to the end of the presentation.
This makes it possible to copy the presentation.

@kbditem{C-c C-v w, slime-copy-presentation-at-point-to-kill-ring}
If point is within a presentation, copy the surrounding presentation
to the kill ring.

@kbditem{C-c C-v r, slime-copy-presentation-at-point-to-repl}
If point is within a presentation, copy the surrounding presentation
to the REPL.

@kbditem{C-c C-v d, slime-describe-presentation-at-point}
If point is within a presentation, describe the associated object.

@kbditem{C-c C-v i, slime-inspect-presentation-at-point}
If point is within a presentation, inspect the associated object with
the SLIME inspector.

@kbditem{C-c C-v n, slime-next-presentation}
Move point to the next presentation in the buffer.

@kbditem{C-c C-v p, slime-previous-presentation}
Move point to the previous presentation in the buffer.

@end table
Similar operations are also possible from the context menu of every
presentation.  Using @kbd{mouse-3} on a presentation, the context menu
opens and offers various commands.  For some objects, specialized
commands are also offered.  Users can define additional specialized
commands by defining a method for
@code{swank::menu-choices-for-presentation}. 


@strong{Warning:} On Lisp implementations without weak hash tables,
all objects associated with presentations are protected from garbage
collection.  If your Lisp image grows too large because of that,
use @kbd{C-c C-v M-o} (@code{slime-clear-presentations}) to remove these
associations.  You can also use the command @kbd{C-c M-o}
(@code{slime-repl-clear-buffer}), which both clears the REPL buffer and
removes all associations of objects with presentations.

@strong{Warning:} Presentations can confuse new users.

@example
CL-USER> (cons 1 2)
@emph{(1 . 2)}
CL-USER> (eq '@emph{(1 . 2)} '@emph{(1 . 2)})
@emph{T}
@end example

One could have expected @code{NIL} here, because it looks like two
fresh cons cells are compared regarding object identity.
However, in the example the presentation @code{@emph{(1 . 2)}} was copied twice
to the REPL.  Thus @code{EQ} is really invoked with the same object,
namely the cons cell that was returned by the first form entered in the
REPL. 

@node Typeout frames
@section Typeout frames

@cindex Typeout Frame

A ``typeout frame'' is a special Emacs frame which is used instead of
the echo area (minibuffer) to display messages from @SLIME{} commands.
This is an optional feature. The advantage of a typeout frame over the
echo area is that it can hold more text, it can be scrolled, and its
contents don't disappear when you press a key. All potentially long
messages are sent to the typeout frame, such as argument lists, macro
expansions, and so on.

@table @kbd
@cmditem{slime-ensure-typeout-frame}
Ensure that a typeout frame exists, creating one if necessary.
@end table

If the typeout frame is closed then the echo area will be used again
as usual.

To have a typeout frame created automatically at startup you should
load the @code{slime-typeout-frame} package. (@pxref{Loading Contribs}.)

The variable @code{slime-typeout-frame-properties} specifies the
height and possibly other properties of the frame.  Its value is
passed to @code{make-frame}. (@inforef{Creating Frames, ,elisp}.)

@node TRAMP
@section TRAMP  

@cindex TRAMP

The package @code{slime-tramp} provides some functions to set up
filename translations for TRAMP. (@pxref{Setting up pathname

@node Documentation Links
@section Documentation Links

For certain error messages, SBCL includes references to the ANSI
Standard or the SBCL User Manual.  The @code{slime-references} package
turns those references into clickable links.  This makes finding the
referenced section of the HyperSpec much easier.

@node Xref and Class Browser
@section Xref and Class Browser

A rudimentary class browser is provided by
the @code{slime-xref-browser} package.

@table @kbd
@cmditem{slime-browse-classes}
This command asks for a class name and displays inheritance tree of
for the class.

@cmditem{slime-browse-xrefs}
This command prompts for a symbol and the kind of cross reference,
e.g. callers.  The cross reference tree rooted at the symbol is then
then displayed.

@end table


@node Highlight Edits
@section Highlight Edits

@code{slime-highlight-edits} is a minor mode to highlight those

@end table

@node Scratch Buffer
@section Scratch Buffer

@anchor{slime-scratch}
The @SLIME{} scratch buffer, in contrib package @code{slime-scratch},
imitates Emacs' usual @code{*scratch*} buffer.
If @code{slime-scratch-file} is set, it is used to back the scratch
