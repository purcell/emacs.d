<h4 class="subsection">7.3.1 Group ecb-general</h4>

<p class="noindent">This group contains general settings for the Emacs code browser:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>activate-before-layout-draw-hook</b><var><a name="index-activate_002dbefore_002dlayout_002ddraw_002dhook-126"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Normal hook run at the end of activating the ecb-package by running
<code>ecb-activate</code>. This hooks are run after all the internal setup
process but directly before(!) drawing the layout specified in
<code>ecb-layout</code> (means before dividing the frame into several
windows).

        <p>A senseful using of this hook can be maximizing the Emacs-frame for
example, because this should be done before the layout is drawn
because ECB computes the size of the ECB-windows with the current
frame size! If you need a hook-option for the real end of the
activating process (i.e. after the layout-drawing) look at
<code>ecb-activate-hook</code>.

        <p>IMPORTANT: The difference between this hook and
<code>ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook</code> is that the latter one is
evaluated always before the layout is redrawn (for example after
calling <code>ecb-redraw-layout</code>) whereas the former one (this hook)
is only evaluated exactly once during the activation-process of ECB. 
So during the activation process there is the following sequence of
hooks:
          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li><code>ecb-activate-before-layout-draw-hook</code> \(this one)
<li><code>ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook</code>
<li>&lt;Drawing the layout&gt;
<li><code>ecb-redraw-layout-after-hook</code>
<li><code>ecb-activate-hook</code>

nil then all ECB-options are checked if their current value have the
correct type. It the type is incorrect the option is either auto. 
upgraded to the new type or reset to the default-value of current ECB
if no upgrade is possible. This feature can also upgrade options which
are renamed in current ECB and try to transform the old-value to the
new named option. After startup all upgraded or reset options are
displayed with their old (before upgrade/reset) and new values. See
also the commands <code>ecb-upgrade-options</code> and
<code>ecb-display-upgraded-options</code>. If this option is off then the
user can perform the check and reset manually with
<code>ecb-upgrade-options</code>.

<blockquote><p>Normal hook run at the beginning of activating the ecb-package by
running <code>ecb-activate</code>. These hooks run before any other tasks of
the activating process are performed. If any of these hooks returns
nil then ECB will not be activated!

        <p>This can be used to check some conditions and then only start ECB if
all conditions are true. For example a function could be added which
returns only nil if Gnus is running. Then calling <code>ecb-activate</code>
or <code>ecb-minor-mode</code> will only start ECB if Gnus is not already
running.

<blockquote><p>Normal hook run at the beginning of deactivating ECB by running
<code>ecb-deactivate</code>. These hooks run before any other tasks of the
deactivating process are performed. If any of these hooks returns nil
then ECB will not be deactivated! See also
<code>ecb-before-activate-hook</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>bucket-node-display</b><var><a name="index-bucket_002dnode_002ddisplay-133"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>How ECB displays bucket-nodes in a ECB tree-buffer. Bucket-nodes have
only one job: Nodes with similar properties will be dropped into one
bucket for such a common property and all these nodes will be added as
children to the bucket-node. Besides being expandable and collapsable
a bucket-node has no senseful action assigned. Examples for
bucket-nodes are &ldquo;[+] Variables, &ldquo;[+] Dependencies&rdquo; etc. in the
Methods-buffer or buckets which combine filenames with same extension
under a bucket-node with name this extension.

        <p>This option defines how bucket-node should be displayed. The name of
the bucket-node is computed by ECB but you can define a prefix, a
suffix and a special face for the bucket-node

        <p>The default are empty prefix/suffix-strings and
<code>ecb-bucket-node-face</code>. But an alternative can be for example
'(&ldquo;[&rdquo; &ldquo;]&rdquo; nil) which means no special face and a display like
&ldquo;[+] [&lt;bucket-name&gt;]&rdquo;.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>clear-caches-before-activate</b><var><a name="index-clear_002dcaches_002dbefore_002dactivate-134"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Clear all ECB internal caches before startup. If t then ECB clears all
its internal caches before starting up. Caches are used for files- and
subdirs (see <code>ecb-cache-directory-contents</code> and
<code>ecb-cache-directory-contents-not</code>) for semantic-tags and for
the history-filter.

        <p>This caches are completely clean at load-time of the ECB-library!

        <p>Default is nil, because is makes sense not to clear these caches at
start-time because ECB is often deacticated temporally especially in
combination with window-managers like escreen.el. In these situations
the internal state of ECB should be preserved for next activation.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>deactivate-hook</b><var><a name="index-deactivate_002dhook-135"></a></var><br>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>debug-mode</b><var><a name="index-debug_002dmode-136"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If not nil ECB displays debug-information in the Messages-buffer. This
is done for some critical situations concerning semantic-tags and
their overlays (or extends for XEmacs). Normally you should not need
this switched on! But if you get errors like &ldquo;destroyed extend&rdquo; for
XEmacs or &ldquo;wrong-argument-type&rdquo; concerning overlays for GNU Emacs then
you should switch on this option and submitting a bug-report to the
ecb-mailing-list (<code>ecb-submit-problem-report</code>) after getting the
error again!

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>key-map</b><var><a name="index-key_002dmap-139"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Specifies all keybindings for the ECB minor-mode key-map. The value is
a cons-cell where the car is a common-prefix key for all the
keybindings. The cdr is a list of keybindings each of them a list
again. A key-binding has the following form:

     <pre class="example">        '(&lt;common-prefix-flag&gt; &lt;keysequence&gt; &lt;function&gt;) where
   </pre>
          <dl>
<dt><code>&lt;common-prefix-flag&gt;</code><dd>If t then the common-prefix-key defined as car of the value (see above)
is used.

          <br><dt><code>&lt;keysequence&gt;</code><dd>If the common prefix-key is used then the final key-binding is the
concatenation of the common-prefix-key (see above) and this
keysequence.

          <br><dt><code>&lt;function&gt;:</code><dd>The function to bind to the key. This can also be a lambda-expression
. 
</dl>

        <p>It is highly recommended to use one of the standard keys C-c or C-x as
first key of your common-prefix-key!

        <p>You MUST change this option via customize to take effect!

        <p>All keysequences must be inserted as a string and must follow the
syntax needed by <code>read-kbd-macro</code> or <code>kbd</code>. This means you
can insert the key in the same manner <kbd>C-h k</kbd> displays keysequences. 
Here is the summary of the syntax:

        <p>Text is divided into &ldquo;words&rdquo; separated by whitespace. Except for the words
described below, the characters of each word go directly as characters of the
keysequence. The whitespace that separates words is ignored. Whitespace in the
macro must be written explicitly, as in <kbd>C-c SPC</kbd>.

          <ul>
<li>The special words RET, SPC, TAB, DEL, LFD, ESC, and NUL represent
special control characters. The words must be written in uppercase.

          <li>A word in angle brackets, e.g., &lt;return&gt;, &lt;down&gt;, &lt;left&gt; or &lt;f1&gt;,
represents a function key. (Note that in the standard configuration,
the function key &lt;return&gt; and the control key RET are synonymous.). 
You can use angle brackets on the words RET, SPC, etc., but they are
not required there.

          <li>Keys can be written by their ASCII code, using a backslash followed by
up to six octal digits. This is the only way to represent keys with
codes above ÿ.

          <li>One or more prefixes M- (meta), C- (control), S- (shift), A- (alt), H-
(hyper), and s- (super) may precede a character or key notation. For
function keys, the prefixes may go inside or outside of the brackets:
C-&lt;down&gt; = &lt;C-down&gt;. The prefixes may be written in any order: M-C-x =
C-M-x. Prefixes are not allowed on multi-key words, e.g., C-abc,
except that the Meta prefix is allowed on a sequence of digits and
optional minus sign: M&ndash;123 = M&ndash; M-1 M-2 M-3.

          <li>The <code>^</code> notation for control characters also works: ^M = C-m. 
</ul>

<blockquote><p>List of major-modes which show or hide the ecb-windows. The value is a
cons-cell where the car contains all major-mode-symbols which should
show the special ecb-windows and the cdr contains all
major-mode-symbols which should hide the special ecb-windows. If the
symbol of a major-mode is neither contained in the car-&ldquo;show-list&rdquo;

<blockquote><p>Run ediff-sessions in the same frame as ECB is running. 
If not nil then ECB ensures that ediff runs in the same frame as ECB and ECB
restores exactly the &ldquo;before-ediff&rdquo;-window-layout after quiting ediff. If
nil then ediff decides in which frame it will run - depending on the current
window-layout (e.g. if the ecb-windows are currently hidden) this can be the
ecb-frame but this can also be a newly created frame or any other frame.
