   Speedbar is a program for Emacs which can be used to summarize
information related to the current buffer.  Its original inspiration is
the `explorer' often used in modern development environments, office
packages, and web browsers.

   Speedbar displays a narrow frame in which a tree view is shown.  This
tree view defaults to containing a list of files and directories.  Files
can be `expanded' to list tags inside. Directories can be expanded to
list the files within itself.  Each file or tag can be jumped to
immediately.

   Speedbar expands upon `explorer' windows by maintaining context with
the user.  For example, when using the file view, the current buffer's
file is highlighted.  Speedbar also mimics the explorer windows by
providing multiple display modes.  These modes come in two flavors.
Major display modes remain consistent across buffers, and minor display
modes appear only when a buffer of the applicable type is shown.  This
allows authors of other packages to provide speedbar summaries
customized to the needs of that mode.

   Throughout this manual, activities are defined as `clicking on', or
`expanding' items.  Clicking means using using `Mouse-2' on a button.
Expanding refers to clicking on an expansion button to display an
expanded summary of the entry the expansion button is on.  *Note Basic

Introduction
************

   To start using speedbar use the command `M-x speedbar RET' or select
it from the Tools menu in versions of Emacs with speedbar installed by
default.  This command will open a new frame to summarize the local
files.  On X Window systems or on MS-Windows, speedbar's frame is twenty
characters wide, and will mimic the height of the frame from which it
was started.  It positions itself to the left or right of the frame you
started it from.

   To use speedbar effectively, it is important to understand its
relationship with the frame you started it from.  This frame is the
"attached frame" which speedbar will use as a reference point.  Once
started, speedbar watches the contents of this frame, and attempts to
make its contents relevant to the buffer loaded into the attached
frame.  In addition, all requests made in speedbar that require the
display of another buffer will display in the attached frame.

   When used in terminal mode, the new frame appears the same size as
the terminal.  Since it is not visible while working in the attached
frame, speedbar will save time by using the "slowbar mode", where no
tracking is done until speedbar is requested to show itself (i.e., the
speedbar's frame becomes the selected frame).

   The function to use when switching between frames using the keyboard
is `speedbar-get-focus'.  This function will toggle between frames, and
it's useful to bind it to a key in terminal mode.  *Note Customizing::.

Basic Navigation
****************

   Speedbar can display different types of data, and has several display
and behavior modes.  These modes all have a common behavior, menu
system, and look.  If one mode is learned, then the other modes are easy
to use.

* Menu:

* Basic Key Bindings::
* Basic Visuals::
* Mouse Bindings::
* Displays Submenu::


File: speedbar.info,  Node: Basic Key Bindings,  Next: Basic Visuals,  Prev: Basic Navigation,  Up: Basic Navigation

Basic Key Bindings
==================

   These key bindings are common across all modes:

`delete, SPC'
     Scroll up and down one page.

`Q'
     Quit speedbar, and kill the frame.

`q'
     Quit speedbar, and hide the frame.  This makes it faster to
     restore the speedbar frame, than if you press `Q'.

`g'
     Refresh whatever contents are in speedbar.

`t'
     Toggle speedbar to and from slowbar mode.  In slowbar mode, frame
     tracking is not done.

`n'
`p'
     Move, respectively, to the next or previous item.  A summary of
     that item will be displayed in the attached frame's minibuffer.

`M-n'
`M-p'
     Move to the next or previous item in a restricted fashion.  If a
     list is open, the cursor will skip over it.  If the cursor is in
     an open list, it will not leave it.

`C-M-n'
`C-M-n'
     Move forwards and backwards across extended groups.  This lets you
     quickly skip over all files, directories, or other common
     sub-items at the same current depth.

`C-x b'
     Switch buffers in the attached frame.

   Speedbar can handle multiple modes.  Two are provided by default.
These modes are File mode, and Buffers mode.  There are accelerators to
switch into these different modes.

`b'
     Switch into Quick Buffers mode (*note Buffer Mode::).  After one
     use, the previous display mode is restored.

`f'
     Switch into File mode.

`r'
     Switch back to the previous mode.

   Some modes provide groups, lists and tags.  *Note Basic Visuals::.
When these are available, some additional common bindings are available.

`RET'
`e'
     Edit/Open the current group or tag.  This behavior is dependent on
     the mode.  In general, files or buffers are opened in the attached
     frame, and directories or group nodes are expanded locally.

`+'
`='
     Expand the current group, displaying sub items.  When used with a
     prefix argument, any data that may have been cached is flushed.
     This is similar to a power click.  *Note Mouse Bindings::.

`-'
     Contract the current group, hiding sub items.


File: speedbar.info,  Node: Basic Visuals,  Next: Mouse Bindings,  Prev: Basic Key Bindings,  Up: Basic Navigation

Basic Visuals
=============

   Speedbar has visual cues for indicating different types of data.
These cues are used consistently across the different speedbar modes to
make them easier to interpret.

   At a high level, in File mode, there are directory buttons, sub
directory buttons, file buttons, tag buttons, and expansion buttons.
This makes it easy to use the mouse to navigate a directory tree, and
quickly view files, or a summary of those files.

   The most basic visual effect used to distinguish between these button
types is color and mouse highlighting.  Anything the mouse highlights
can be clicked on and is called a button (*note Mouse Bindings::).
Anything not highlighted by the mouse will not be clickable.

   Text in speedbar consists of four different types of data.  Knowing
how to read these textual elements will make it easier to navigate by
identifying the types of data available.

Groups
......

   Groups summarize information in a single line, and provide a high
level view of more complex systems, like a directory tree, or manual
chapters.

   Groups appear at different indentation levels, and are prefixed with
a `+' in some sort of `box'.  The group name will summarize the
information within it, and the expansion box will display that
information inline.  In File mode, directories and files are `groups'
where the `+' is surrounded by brackets like this:

     <+> include
     <-> src
      [+] foo.c

   In this example, we see both open and closed directories, in
addition to a file.  The directories have a box consisting of angle
brackets, and a file uses square brackets.

   In all modes, a group can be `edited' by pressing `RET', meaning a
file will be opened, or a directory explicitly opened in speedbar.  A
group can be expanded or contracted using `+' or `-'.  *Note Basic Key
Bindings::.

   Sometimes groups may have a `?' in its indicator box.  This means
that it is a group type, but there are no contents, or no known way of
extracting contents of that group.

   When a group has been expanded, the indicator button changes from
`+' to `-'.  This indicates that the contents are being shown.  Click
the `-' button to contract the group, or hide the contents currently
displayed.

Tags
....

   Tags are the leaf nodes of the tree system.  Tags are generally
prefixed with a simple character, such as `>'.  Tags can only be jumped
to using `RET' or `e'.

Boolean Flags
.............

   Sometimes a group or tag is given a boolean flag.  These flags
appear as extra text characters at the end of the line.  File mode uses
boolean flags, such as a `*' to indicate that a file has been checked
out of a versioning system.

   For additional flags, see *Note File Mode::, and *Note Version
Control::.

Unadorned Text
..............

   Unadorned text generally starts in column 0, without any special
symbols prefixing them.  In Buffers mode different buffer groups are
prefixed with a description of what the following buffers are (Files,
scratch buffers, and invisible buffers.)

   Unadorned text will generally be colorless, and not clickable.

Color Cues
..........

   Each type of Group, item indicator, and label is given a different
color.  The colors chosen are dependent on whether the background color
is light or dark.  Of important note is that the `current item', which
may be a buffer or file name, is highlighted red, and underlined.

   Colors can be customized from the group `speedbar-faces'.  Some
modes, such as for Info, will use the Info colors instead of default
speedbar colors as an indication of what is currently being displayed.

   The face naming convention mirrors the File display mode.  Modes
which do not use files will attempt to use the same colors on analogous
entries.


File: speedbar.info,  Node: Mouse Bindings,  Next: Displays Submenu,  Prev: Basic Visuals,  Up: Basic Navigation

Mouse Bindings
==============

   The mouse has become a common information navigation tool.  Speedbar
will use the mouse to navigate file systems, buffer lists, and other
data.  The different textual cues provide buttons which can be clicked
on (*note Basic Visuals::).  Anything that highlights can be clicked on
with the mouse, or affected by the menu.

   The mouse bindings are:

`Mouse-1'
     Move cursor to that location.

`Mouse-2'
`Double-Mouse-1'
     Activate the current button.  `Double-Mouse-1' is called a "double
     click" on other platforms, and is useful for windows users with two
     button mice.

`S-Mouse-2'
`S-Double-Mouse-1'
     This has the same effect as `Mouse-2', except it is called a power
     click.  This means that if a group with an expansion button `+' is
     clicked, any caches are flushed, and subitems re-read.  If it is a
     name, it will be opened in a new frame.

`Mouse-3'
     Activate the speedbar menu.  The item selected affects the line
     clicked, not the line where the cursor was.

`Mouse-1 (mode line)'
     Activate the menu.  This affects the item the cursor is on before
     the click, since the mouse was not clicked on anything.

`C-Mouse-1'
     Buffers sub-menu.  The buffer in the attached frame is switched.

   When the mouse moves over buttons in speedbar, details of that item
should be displayed in the minibuffer of the attached frame.  Sometimes
this can contain extra information such as file permissions, or tag
location.


File: speedbar.info,  Node: Displays Submenu,  Prev: Mouse Bindings,  Up: Basic Navigation

Displays Submenu
================

   You can display different data by using different display modes.
These specialized modes make it easier to navigate the relevant pieces
of information, such as files and directories, or buffers.

   In the main menu, found by clicking `Mouse-3', there is a submenu
labeled `Displays'.  This submenu lets you easily choose between
different display modes.

   The contents are modes currently loaded into emacs.  By default, this
would include Files, Quick Buffers, and Buffers.  Other major display
modes such as Info are loaded separately.


File: speedbar.info,  Node: File Mode,  Next: Buffer Mode,  Prev: Basic Navigation,  Up: Top

File Mode
*********

   File mode displays a summary of your current directory.  You can
display files in the attached frame, or summarize the tags found in
files.  You can even see if a file is checked out of a version control
system, or has some associated object file.

   Advanced behavior, like copying and renaming files, is also provided.

* Menu:

* Directory Display::   What the display means.
* Hidden Files::        How to display hidden files.
* File Key Bindings::   Performing file operations.


File: speedbar.info,  Node: Directory Display,  Next: Hidden Files,  Prev: File Mode,  Up: File Mode

Directory Display
=================

   There are three major sections in the display.  The first line or
two is the root directory speedbar is currently viewing.  You can jump
to one of the parent directories by clicking on the name of the
directory you wish to jump to.

   Next, directories are listed.  A directory starts with the group
indicator button `<+>'.  Clicking the directory name makes speedbar
load that directory as the root directory for its display.  Clicking the
`<+>' button will list all directories and files beneath.

   Next, files are listed.  Files start with the group indicator `[+]'
or `[?]'.  You can jump to a file in the attached frame by clicking on
the file name.  You can expand a file and look at its tags by clicking
on the `[+]' symbol near the file name.

   A typical session might look like this:

     ~/lisp/
     <+> checkdoc
     <+> eieio
     <-> speedbar
      [+] Makefile
      [+] rpm.el #
      [+] sb-gud.el #
      [+] sb-info.el #
      [+] sb-rmail.el #
      [+] sb-w3.el
      [-] speedbar.el *!
       {+} Types
       {+} Variables
       {+} def (group)
       {+} speedbar-
      [+] speedbar.texi *
     <+> testme
     [+] align.el
     [+] autoconf.el

   In this example, you can see several directories.  The directory
`speedbar' has been opened inline.  Inside the directory `speedbar',
the file `speedbar.el' has its tags exposed.  These tags are extensive,
and they are summarized into tag groups.

   Files get additional boolean flags associated with them.  Valid
flags are:

`*'
     This file has been checked out of a version control system.  *Note
     Version Control::.

`#'
     This file has an up to date object file associated with it.  The
     variable `speedbar-obj-alist' defines how speedbar determines this
     value.

`!'
     This file has an out of date object file associated with it.

   A Tag group is prefixed with the symbol `{+}'.  Clicking this symbol
will show all symbols that have been organized into that group.
Different types of files have unique tagging methods as defined by their
major mode.  Tags are generated with either the `imenu' package, or
through the `etags' interface.

   Tag groups are defined in multiple ways which make it easier to find
the tag you are looking for.  Imenu keywords explicitly create groups,
and speedbar will automatically create groups if tag lists are too long.

   In our example, Imenu created the groups `Types' and `Variables'.
All remaining top-level symbols are then regrouped based on the
variable `speedbar-tag-hierarchy-method'.  The subgroups `def' and
`speedbar-' are groupings where the first few characters of the given
symbols are specified in the group name.  Some group names may say
something like `speedbar-t to speedbar-v', indicating that all symbols
which alphabetically fall between those categories are included in that
sub-group.  *Note Tag Hierarchy Methods::.


File: speedbar.info,  Node: Hidden Files,  Next: File Key Bindings,  Prev: Directory Display,  Up: File Mode

Hidden Files
============

   On GNU and Unix systems, a hidden file is a file whose name starts
with a period.  They are hidden from a regular directory listing
because the user is not generally interested in them.

   In speedbar, a hidden file is a file which isn't very interesting and
might prove distracting to the user.  Any uninteresting files are
removed from the File display.  There are two levels of uninterest in
speedbar.  The first level of uninterest are files which have no
expansion method, or way of extracting tags.  You can define which
files are interesting with `speedbar-supported-extension-expressions'.
The second level is any file that matches the same pattern used for
completion in `find-file'.  This is derived from the variable
`completion-ignored-extensions'.  This filter will override the
supported extensions, so beif you add something to be supported, and it
doesn't appear, check for this.

   You can toggle the display of uninteresting files from the toggle
menu item `Show All Files'.  This will display all level one hidden
files.  These files will be shown with a `?' indicator.  Level 2 hidden
files will still not be shown.

   Object files fall into the category of level 2 hidden files.  You can
determine their presence by the `#' and `!' file indicators.  *Note
Directory Display::.


File: speedbar.info,  Node: File Key Bindings,  Prev: Hidden Files,  Up: File Mode

File Key Bindings
=================

   File mode has key bindings permitting different file system
operations such as copy or rename.  These commands all operate on the
"current file".  In this case, the current file is the file at point,
or clicked on when pulling up the menu.

`U'
     Move the entire speedbar display up one directory.

`I'
     Display information in the minibuffer about this line.  This is
     the same information shown when navigating with `n' and `p', or
     moving the mouse over an item.

`B'
     Byte compile the Emacs Lisp file on this line.

`L'
     Load the Emacs Lisp file on this line.  If a `.elc' file exists,
     optionally load that.

`C'
     Copy the current file to some other location.

`R'
     Rename the current file, possibly moving it to some other location.

`D'
     Delete the current file.

`O'
     Delete the current file's object file.  Use the symbols `#' and
     `!' to determine if there is an object file available.

   One menu item toggles the display of all available files.  By
default, only files which Emacs understands, and knows how to convert
into a tag list, are shown.  By showing all files, additional files
such as text files are also displayed, but they are prefixed with the
`[?]' symbol.  This means that it is a file, but Emacs doesn't know how
to expand it.


File: speedbar.info,  Node: Buffer Mode,  Next: Minor Modes,  Prev: File Mode,  Up: Top

Buffer Mode
***********

   Buffer mode is very similar to File mode, except that instead of
tracking the current directory and all files available there, the
current list of Emacs buffers is shown.

   These buffers can have their tags expanded in the same way as files,
and uses the same unknown file indicator (*note File Mode::).

   Buffer mode does not have file operation bindings, but the following
buffer specific key bindings are available:

`k'
     Kill this buffer.  Do not touch its file.

`r'
     Revert this buffer, reloading from disk.

   In addition to Buffer mode, there is also Quick Buffer mode.  In
fact, Quick Buffers is bound to the `b' key.  The only difference
between Buffers and Quick Buffers is that after one operation  is
performed which affects the attached frame, the display is immediately
reverted to the last displayed mode.

   Thus, if you are in File mode, and you need quick access to a buffer,
press `b', click on the buffer you want, and speedbar will revert back
to File mode.


File: speedbar.info,  Node: Minor Modes,  Next: Customizing,  Prev: Buffer Mode,  Up: Top

Minor Display Modes
*******************

   For some buffers, a list of files and tags makes no sense.  This
could be because files are not currently in reference (such as web
pages), or that the files you might be interested have special
properties (such as email folders.)

   In these cases, a minor display mode is needed.  A minor display mode
will override any major display mode currently being displayed for the
duration of the specialized buffer's use.  Minor display modes will
follow the general rules of their major counterparts in terms of key
bindings and visuals, but will have specialized behaviors.

* Menu:

* RMAIL::  Managing folders in speedbar
* Info::   Browsing topics in speedbar
* GDB::    Managing the current stack trace in speedbar


File: speedbar.info,  Node: RMAIL,  Next: Info,  Prev: Minor Modes,  Up: Minor Modes

RMAIL
=====

   When using RMAIL, speedbar will display two sections.  The first is a
layer one reply button.  Clicking here will initialize a reply buffer
showing only this email address in the `To:' field.

   The second section lists all RMAIL folders in the same directory as
your main RMAIL folder.  The general rule is that RMAIL folders always
appear in all caps, or numbers.  It is possible to save mail in folders
with lower case letters, but there is no clean way of detecting such
RMAIL folders without opening them all.

   Each folder can be visited by clicking the name.  You can move mail
from the current RMAIL folder into a different folder by clicking the
`<M>' button.  The `M' stands for Move.

   In this way you can manage your existing RMAIL folders fairly easily
using the mouse.


File: speedbar.info,  Node: Info,  Next: GDB,  Prev: RMAIL,  Up: Minor Modes

Info
====

   When browsing Info files, all local relevant information is
displayed in the info buffer and a topical high-level view is provided
in speedbar.  All top-level info nodes are shown in the speedbar frame,
and can be jumped to by clicking the name.

   You can open these nodes with the `[+]' button to see what sub-topics
are available.  Since these sub-topics are not examined until you click
the `[+]' button, sometimes a `[?]' will appear when you click on a
`[+]', indicating that there are no sub-topics.


File: speedbar.info,  Node: GDB,  Prev: Info,  Up: Minor Modes

GDB
===

   If you are debugging an application with GDB in Emacs, speedbar can
show you the current stack when the current buffer is the `*gdb*'
buffer.  Usually, it will just report that there is no stack, but when
the application is stopped, the current stack will be shown.

   You can click on any stack element and gdb will move to that stack
level.  You can then check variables local to that level at the GDB
prompt.

   This mode has the unfortunate side-effect of breaking GDB's repeat
feature when you hit `RET' since your previous command is overridden
with a stack fetching command.


File: speedbar.info,  Node: Customizing,  Next: Extending,  Prev: Minor Modes,  Up: Top

Customizing
***********

   Speedbar is highly customizable, with a plethora of control elements.
Since speedbar is so visual and reduces so much information, this is an
important aspect of its behavior.

   In general, there are three custom groups you can use to quickly
modify speedbar's behavior.

`speedbar'
     Basic speedbar behaviors.

`speedbar-vc'
     Customizations regarding version control handling.

`speedbar-faces'
     Customize speedbar's many colors and fonts.

* Menu:

* Frames and Faces::        Visible behaviors.
* Tag Hierarchy Methods::   Customizing how tags are displayed.
* Version Control::         Adding new VC detection modes.
* Hooks::                   The many hooks you can use.


File: speedbar.info,  Node: Frames and Faces,  Next: Tag Hierarchy Methods,  Prev: Customizing,  Up: Customizing

Frames and Faces
================

   There are several faces speedbar generates to provide a consistent
color scheme across display types.  You can customize these faces using
your favorite method.  They are:

speedbar-button-face
     Face used on expand/contract buttons.

speedbar-file-face
     Face used on Files.  Should also be used on non-directory like
     nodes.

speedbar-directory-face
     Face used for directories, or nodes which consist of groups of
     other nodes.

speedbar-tag-face
     Face used for tags in a file, or for leaf items.

speedbar-selected-face
     Face used to highlight the selected item.  This would be the
     current file being edited.

speedbar-highlight-face
     Face used when the mouse passes over a button.

   You can also customize speedbar's initial frame parameters.  How
this is accomplished is dependent on your platform being Emacs or
XEmacs.

   In Emacs, change the alist `speedbar-frame-parameters'.  This
variable is used to set up initial details.  Height is also
automatically added when speedbar is created, though you can override
it.

   In XEmacs, change the plist `speedbar-frame-plist'.  This is the
XEmacs way of doing the same thing.


File: speedbar.info,  Node: Tag Hierarchy Methods,  Next: Version Control,  Prev: Frames and Faces,  Up: Customizing

Tag Hierarchy Methods
=====================

   When listing tags within a file, it is possible to get an annoyingly
long list of entries.  Imenu (which generates the tag list in Emacs)
will group some classes of items automatically.   Even here, however,
some tag groups can be quite large.

   To solve this problem, tags can be grouped into logical units
through a hierarchy processor.  The specific variable to use is
`speedbar-tag-hierarchy-method'.  There are several methods that can be
applied in any order.  They are:

`speedbar-trim-words-tag-hierarchy'
     Find a common prefix for all elements of a group, and trim it off.

`speedbar-prefix-group-tag-hierarchy'
     If a group is too large, place sets of tags into bins based on
     common prefixes.

`speedbar-simple-group-tag-hierarchy'
     Take all items in the top level list not in a group, and stick
     them into a `Tags' group.

`speedbar-sort-tag-hierarchy'
     Sort all items, leaving groups on top.

   You can also add your own functions to reorganize tags as you see
fit.

   Some other control variables are:

`speedbar-tag-group-name-minimum-length'
     Default value: 4.

     The minimum length of a prefix group name before expanding.  Thus,
     if the `speedbar-tag-hierarchy-method' includes
     `speedbar-prefix-group-tag-hierarchy' and one such group's common
     characters is less than this number of characters, then the group
     name will be changed to the form of:

          worda to wordb

     instead of just

          word

     This way we won't get silly looking listings.

`speedbar-tag-split-minimum-length'
     Default value: 20.

     Minimum length before we stop trying to create sub-lists in tags.
     This is used by all tag-hierarchy methods that break large lists
     into sub-lists.

`speedbar-tag-regroup-maximum-length'
     Default value: 10.

     Maximum length of submenus that are regrouped.  If the regrouping
     option is used, then if two or more short subgroups are next to
     each other, then they are combined until this number of items is
     reached.

Version Control
===============

   When using the file mode in speedbar, information regarding a version
control system adds small details to the display.  If a file is in a
version control system, and is "checked out" or "locked" locally, an
asterisk `*' appears at the end of the file name.  In addition, the
directory name for Version Control systems are left out of the speedbar
display.

   You can easily add new version control systems into speedbar's
detection scheme.  To make a directory "disappear" from the list, use
the variable `speedbar-directory-unshown-regexp'.

   Next, you need to write entries for two hooks.  The first is
`speedbar-vc-directory-enable-hook' which will enable a VC check in the
current directory for the group of files being checked.  Your hook
function should take one parameter (the directory to check) and return
`t' if your VC method is in control here.

   The second function is `speedbar-vc-in-control-hook'.  This hook
takes two parameters, the PATH of the file to check, and the FILE name.
Return `t' if you want to have the asterisk placed near this file.

   Lastly, you can change the VC indicator using the variable
`speedbar-vc-indicator', and specify a single character string.

Hooks
=====

   There are several hooks in speedbar allowing custom behaviors to be
added.  Available hooks are:

`speedbar-visiting-file-hook'
     Hooks run when speedbar visits a file in the selected frame.

`speedbar-visiting-tag-hook'
     Hooks run when speedbar visits a tag in the selected frame.

`speedbar-load-hook'
     Hooks run when speedbar is loaded.

`speedbar-reconfigure-keymaps-hook'
     Hooks run when the keymaps are regenerated.  Keymaps are
     reconfigured whenever modes change.  This will let you add custom
     key bindings.

`speedbar-before-popup-hook'
     Hooks called before popping up the speedbar frame.  New frames are
     often popped up when "power clicking" on an item to view it.

`speedbar-before-delete-hook'
     Hooks called before deleting or hiding the speedbar frame.

`speedbar-mode-hook'
     Hooks called after creating a speedbar buffer.

`speedbar-timer-hook'
     Hooks called after running the speedbar timer function.

`speedbar-scanner-reset-hook'
     Hook called whenever generic scanners are reset.  Set this to
     implement your own scanning or rescan safe functions with state
     data.

*********

   Speedbar can run different types of Major display modes such as Files
(*note File Mode::), and Buffers (*note Buffer Mode::).  It can also
manage different minor display modes for use with buffers handling
specialized data.

   These major and minor display modes are handled through an extension
system which permits specialized keymaps and menu extensions, in
addition to a unique rendering function.  You can also specify a wide
range of tagging functions.  The default uses `imenu', but new tagging
methods can be easily added.  In this chapter, you will learn how to
write your own major or minor display modes, and how to create
specialized tagging functions.

Minor Display Modes
===================

   A "minor display mode" is a mode useful when using a specific type of
buffer.  This mode might not be useful for any other kind of data or
mode, or may just be more useful that a files or buffers based mode when
working with a specialized mode.

   Examples that already exist for speedbar include RMAIL, Info, and
gdb.  These modes display information specific to the major mode shown
in the attached frame.

   To enable a minor display mode in your favorite Major mode, follow
these steps.  The string `NAME' is the name of the major mode being
augmented with speedbar.

  1. Create the keymap variable `NAME-speedbar-key-map'.

  2. Create a function, named whatever you like, which assigns values
     into your keymap.  Use this command to create the keymap before
     assigning bindings:

              (setq NAME-speedbar-key-map (speedbar-make-specialized-keymap))

     This function creates a special keymap for use in speedbar.

  3. Call your install function, or assign it to a hook like this:

          (if (featurep 'speedbar)
              (NAME-install-speedbar-variables)
            (add-hook 'speedbar-load-hook 'NAME-install-speedbar-variables))

  4. Create an easymenu compatible vector named
     `NAME-speedbar-menu-items'.  This will be spliced into speedbar's
     control menu.

  5. Create a function called `NAME-speedbar-buttons'.  This function
     should take one variable, which is the buffer for which it will
     create buttons.   At this time `(current-buffer)' will point to the
     uncleared speedbar buffer.

   When writing `NAME-speedbar-buttons', the first thing you will want
to do is execute a check to see if you need to re-create your display.
If it needs to be cleared, you need to erase the speedbar buffer
yourself, and start drawing buttons.  *Note Creating a display::.


File: speedbar.info,  Node: Major Display Modes,  Next: Tagging Extensions,  Prev: Minor Display Modes,  Up: Extending

Major Display Modes
===================

   Creating a "Major Display Mode" for speedbar requires authoring a
keymap, an easy-menu segment, and writing several functions.  These
items can be given any name, and are made the same way as in a minor
display mode (*note Minor Display Modes::).  Once this is done, these
items need to be registered.

   Because this setup activity may or may not have speedbar available
when it is being loaded, it is necessary to create an install function.
This function should create and initialize the keymap, and add your
expansions into the customization tables.

   When creating the keymap, use the function
`speedbar-make-specialized-keymap' instead of other keymap making
functions.  This will provide you with the initial bindings needed.
Some common speedbar functions you might want to bind are:

`speedbar-edit-line'
     Edit the item on the current line.

`speedbar-expand-line'
     Expand the item under the cursor.  With a numeric argument
     (`C-u'), flush cached data before expanding.

`speedbar-contract-line'
     Contract the item under the cursor.

   These function require that function `speedbar-line-path' be
correctly overloaded to work.

   Next, register your extension like this;

       (speedbar-add-expansion-list '("MyExtension"
                                      MyExtension-speedbar-menu-items
                                      MyExtension-speedbar-key-map
                                      MyExtension-speedbar-buttons))

   There are no limitations to the names you use.

   The first parameter is the string representing your display mode.
The second parameter is a variable name containing an easymenu
compatible menu definition.  This will be stuck in the middle of
speedbar's menu.  The third parameter is the variable name containing
the keymap we discussed earlier.  The last parameter is a function
which draws buttons for your mode.  This function must take two
parameters.  The directory currently being displayed, and the depth at
which you should start rendering buttons.  The function will then draw
(starting at the current cursor position) any buttons deemed necessary
based on the input parameters.  *Note Creating a display::.

   Next, you need to register function overrides.  This may look
something like this:

     (speedbar-add-mode-functions-list
      '("MYEXTENSION"
        (speedbar-item-info . MyExtension-speedbar-item-info)
        (speedbar-line-path . MyExtension-speedbar-line-path)))

   The first element in the list is the name of you extension.  The
second is an alist of functions to overload.  The function to overload
is first, followed by what you want called instead.

   For `speedbar-line-path' your function should take an optional DEPTH
parameter.  This is the starting depth for heavily indented lines.  If
it is not provided, you can derive it like this:

     (save-match-data
       (if (not depth)
           (progn
             (beginning-of-line)
             (looking-at "^\\([0-9]+\\):")
             (setq depth (string-to-int (match-string 1)))))

where the depth is stored as invisible text at the beginning of each
line.

   The path returned should be the full path name of the file associated
with that line.  If the cursor is on a tag, then the file containing
that tag should be returned.  This is critical for built in file based
functions to work (meaning less code for you to write).  If your display
does not deal in files, you do not need to overload this function.

   The function `speedbar-item-info', however, is very likely to need
overloading.  This function takes no parameters and must derive a text
summary to display in the minibuffer.

   There are several helper functions you can use if you are going to
use built in tagging.  These functions can be `or'ed since each one
returns non-nil if it displays a message.  They are:

`speedbar-item-info-file-helper'
     This takes an optional FILENAME parameter.  You can derive your own
     filename, or it will derive it using a (possibly overloaded)
     function `speedbar-line-file'.  It shows details about a file.

`speedbar-item-info-tag-helper'
     If the current line is a tag, then display information about that
     tag, such as its parent file, and location.

   Your custom function might look like this:

     (defun MyExtension-item-info ()
       "Display information about the current line."
       (or (speedbar-item-info-tag-helper)
           (message "Interesting detail.")))

   Once you have done all this, speedbar will show an entry in the
`Displays' menu declaring that your extension is available.

Tagging Extensions
==================

   It is possible to create new methods for tagging files in speedbar.
To do this, you need two basic functions, one function to fetch the
tags from a buffer, the other to insert them below the filename.

 - Function: my-fetch-dynamic-tags file
     Parse FILE for a list of tags.  Return the list, or `t' if there
     was an error.  FILE is not necessarily available as an buffer when
     your function is called.  Be sure to load it if it is needed with
     code like this:

          (save-excursion
            (set-buffer (find-file-noselect file))
            ...
            )

   The non-error return value can be anything, as long as it can be
inserted by its paired function:

 - Function: my-insert-tag-list level lst
     Insert a list of tags LST started at indentation level LEVEL.
     Creates buttons for each tag, and provides any other display
     information required.

   It is often useful to use `speedbar-create-tag-hierarchy' on your
token list.  See that function's documentation for details on what it
requires.

   Once these two functions are written, modify the variable
`speedbar-dynamic-tags-function-list' to include your parser at the
beginning, like this:

     (add-to-list 'speedbar-dynamic-tags-function-list
     	     '(my-fetch-dynamic-tags  . my-insert-tag-list))

   If your parser is only good for a few types of files, make sure that
it is either a buffer local modification, or that the tag generator
returns `t' for non valid buffers.


File: speedbar.info,  Node: Creating a display,  Prev: Tagging Extensions,  Up: Extending

Creating a display
==================

   Rendering a display in speedbar is completely flexible.  When your
button function is called, see *Note Minor Display Modes::, and *Note
Major Display Modes::, you have control to `insert' anything you want.

   The conventions allow almost anything to be inserted, but several
helper functions are provided to make it easy to create the standardized
buttons.

   To understand the built in functions, each `button' in speedbar
consists of four important pieces of data.  The text to be displayed,
token data to be associated with the text, a function to call, and some
face to display it in.

   When a function is provided, then that text becomes mouse activated,
meaning the mouse will highlight the text.

   Additionally, for data which can form deep trees, each line is given
a depth which indicates how far down the tree it is.  This information
is stored in invisible text at the beginning of each line, and is used
by the navigation commands.

 - Function: speedbar-insert-button text face mouse function &optional
          token prevline
     This function inserts one button into the current location.  TEXT
     is the text to insert.  FACE is the face in which it will be
     displayed.   MOUSE is the face to display over the text when the
     mouse passes over it.  FUNCTION is called whenever the user clicks
     on the text.

     The optional argument TOKEN is extra data to associated with the
     text.  Lastly PREVLINE should be non-nil if you want this line to
     appear directly after the last button which was created instead of
     on the next line.

 - Function: speedbar-make-tag-line exp-button-type exp-button-char
          exp-button-function exp-button-data tag-button
          tag-button-function tag-button-data tag-button-face depth
     Create a tag line with EXP-BUTTON-TYPE for the small expansion
     button.  This is the button that expands or contracts a node (if
     applicable), and EXP-BUTTON-CHAR the character in it (`+', `-',
     `?', etc).  EXP-BUTTON-FUNCTION is the function to call if it's
     clicked on.  Button types are `'bracket', `'angle', `'curly',
     `'expandtag', `'statictag', or nil.  EXP-BUTTON-DATA is extra data
     attached to the text forming the expansion button.

     Next, TAG-BUTTON is the text of the tag.  TAG-BUTTON-FUNCTION is
     the function to call if clicked on, and TAG-BUTTON-DATA is the
     data to attach to the text field (such a tag positioning, etc).
     TAG-BUTTON-FACE is a face used for this type of tag.

     Lastly, DEPTH shows the depth of expansion.

     This function assumes that the cursor is in the speedbar window at
     the position to insert a new item, and that the new item will end
     with a CR.

 - Function: speedbar-insert-generic-list level list expand-fun find-fun
     At LEVEL, (the current indentation level desired) insert a generic
     multi-level alist LIST.  Associations with lists get `{+}' tags
     (to expand into more nodes) and those with positions or other data
     just get a `>' as the indicator.  `{+}' buttons will have the
     function EXPAND-FUN and the token is the `cdr' list.  The token
     name will have the function FIND-FUN and not token.

     Each element of the list can have one of these forms:

    `(NAME . marker-or-number)'
          One tag at this level.

    `(NAME (NAME . marker-or-number) (NAME . marker-or-number) ... )'
          One group of tags.

    `(NAME marker-or-number (NAME . marker-or-number) ... )'
          One Group of tags where the group has a starting position.

     When you use `speedbar-insert-generic-list', there are some
     variables you can set buffer-locally to change the behavior.  The
     most obvious is `speedbar-tag-hierarchy-method'.  *Note Tag
     Hierarchy Methods::.

      - Variable: speedbar-generic-list-group-expand-button-type
          This is the button type used for groups of tags, whether
          expanded or added in via a hierarchy method.  Two good values
          are `'curly' and `'expandtag'.  Curly is the default button,
          and `'expandtag' is useful if the groups also has a position.

      - Variable: speedbar-generic-list-tag-button-type
          This is the button type used for a single tag.  Two good
          values are `nil' and `'statictag'.  `nil' is the default, and
          `'statictag' has the same width as `'expandtag'.
