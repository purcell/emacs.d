NAME
    yaml-mode - Simple major mode to edit YAML file for emacs

VERSION
    0.0.3

SYNOPSIS
    To install, just drop this file into a directory in your
    `load-path' and (optionally) byte-compile it.  To automatically
    handle files ending in '.yml', add something like:

    (require 'yaml-mode)
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.yml$" . yaml-mode))

    to your .emacs file.

    Unlike python-mode, this mode follows the Emacs convention of not
    binding the ENTER key to `newline-and-indent'.  To get this
    behavior, add the key definition to `yaml-mode-hook':

    (add-hook 'yaml-mode-hook
      '(lambda ()
        (define-key yaml-mode-map "\C-m" 'newline-and-indent)))

DESCRIPTION
    yaml-mode is major mode for emacs.

INSTALL
    You can install yaml-mode typing below.

        % make
        % make install

        or

        % make PREFIX=/your/home/dir
        % make install PREFIX=/your/home/dir

SETTING
    see SYNOPSIS.
