# Wiki maintainer instructions

1. Checkout wiki repo at `git@github.com:emacs-helm/helm.wiki.git`
2. Get markdown-pp at https://github.com/jreese/markdown-pp
3. Install markdown-pp

   For help on setup.py:

   `$ sudo python setup.py help`

   For installing:

   `$ sudo python setup.py install`

4. Edit on helm repo `Home.mdpp`.
5. Run markdown.pp.py: (This will create the table of contents)

   `$ path/to/markdown-pp.py Home.mdpp Home.md`

   See the [Readme][2] for more details.
6. Merge the resulting file `Home.md` with the one on the helm wiki repo you checked out in 1.

# Install

First get the files from the git repo:

The Helm git repo is at:
 <https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm>
 There, you will find tarballs of differents versions in the `Tags` section.

To get it with git:

    git clone https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm

Once you have the helm directory, `cd` into it and run `make`.
Edit your `init.el` file and add:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/helm/directory")
    (require 'helm-config)

For a quick try, you can also run the shell script provided with helm if your system support it:

    ./emacs-helm.sh

NOTE: If you install Helm in a different way using your own autoloads and personal configuration,
      be sure to know and understand what you are doing, otherwise expect diverse bugs and failures.
      You are warned!

# Emacs completion vs Helm

Emacs' default minibuffer completion is subtly different to Helm, and many
([1][mental1], [2][mental2], [3][mental3]) new comers struggle with the difference.

## Emacs default completion is **minibuffer centric**

Emacs helps you narrow down your selection by transforming your minibuffer
input when you hit `<tab>`.  And then your give it some more detail and hit
`<tab>` again, until finally,the **minibuffer** contains the desired input and
you hit `<enter>` to select it.

## Helm is **completion window centric**

In Helm, you don't pay attention to the minibuffer.  Instead, you look at the
completion window *and* the currently highlighted item.

You narrow the list shown in the **completion window** by providing more input.

When the item is close enough to the current highlight, you navigate to it
with `<C-n>` and hit `<enter>` to select it.

## The key implications of the helm "mental model"

1. `<tab>` is not needed to expand the minibuffer input.

    - The minibuffer need not *ever* contain the selection you want, so
      there is no point in transforming it.

2. Therefore `<tab>` is used to select a different action in Helm.

    - In Emacs completion, there is only one action available, but Helm
      offers many actions.
    - This is a feature.  Please don't ask how to make `<tab>` do expansion.

# Debugging

If you experiment problems with helm, be sure to reproduce the problem starting with `emacs -Q`
and then installing Helm as described in the Install section.
You can also run `emacs-helm.sh` directly if supported by your system.


# General helm commands

 Helm needs you to remember only a few binding unlike all other Emacs
applications. Thus, all bindings are auto documented.

By default, Helm shows you the most useful bindings in the mode-line.
You will see some more specific commands in the header of the helm
buffer.

So when helm starts, you have to remember:

-   Access to action menu with

        TAB

-   Use persistent actions with

        C-z

-   Mark candidate with

        M-<SPACE>

So there are three bindings to remember and they are also documented
in mode-line. For more, hitting

        C-h m

while in helm session will show you all other bindings.
 NOTE: Some helm commands have a special keymap, you can access infos on
these keymap with `C-c ?`, it should be documented in the mode-line.

## Yanking text

To yank the symbol at point from `helm-current-buffer` (i.e. buffer where a
helm command originated):

        M-n

Alternatively, customize `helm-yank-symbol-first` to enable

        C-w

to always yank the whole symbol on first invocation.

# Overview of preconfigured helm commands

 To start with helm, a set of commands have
been set for you in the helm menu. The bindings of all these commands are
prefixed with `helm-command-prefix-key` (default to `C-x c`).

To discover more helm commands run `helm all commands`
(helm-execute-helm-command) from the menu. Or run helm-M-x (`helm-command-prefix-key` `M-x`) and type helm.

Typing `helm-command-prefix-key` before a normal command like `M-x`
will run the helm version of that command: `helm-M-x`. If you prefer
the helm version of a command, you should bind it to something more
convenient like `M-x`. To replace the Emacs original keybinding, paste
this in your init.el:

    (global-set-key (kbd "M-x") 'helm-M-x)

# Helm Find Files

 `helm-find-files` provides you with a way to navigate in your file
hierarchy easily. All the actions you can apply to files from here are
described in this section.

You can find it in the menu under `helm-command-prefix-key` or
 as the keychain `C-x C-f`.

If you prefer the helm version of the file finder, you can bind it to
C-x C-f to replace the standard find-file:

    (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-f") 'helm-find-files)

It also works well with tramp. Try it!

NOTE: Starting helm-find-files with C-u will show you a little history
of the last visited directories.

## Navigation

 Helm-find-files does not start your working directory at / but on
default-directory or thing-at-point which it gets from ffap. If you
are on a url, a mail address, etc... it will do the right thing.

`helm-find-files` works like find-file (C-x C-f), but if you use it with
helm-match-plugin.el, you have to add a space and then the next part of
pattern you want to match:

Example:

    Find Files or url: ~/
    That show all ~/ directory.

    Find Files or url: ~/des
    will show all what begin with "des"

    Find Files or url: ~/ esk
    (Notice the space after ~/) will show all what contain esk.

    Find Files or url: ~/ el$
    Will show all what finish with el


Inside the `helm-find-files` buffer, you can move your selected row up
or down with C-n C-p or arrow keys. When a row is selected, `C-z` performs the
default action, which is different depending on the context.

When you are on a file, `C-z` will show only this file-name in the
helm buffer. On a directory, `C-z` will step down into this directory
to continue searching in it. On a symlink, `C-z` will expand to the
true name of symlink (moving your mouse cursor over a symlink will
also show the true name).

So it is quite easy to navigate in your files with helm-find-files.

C-. will navigate to the root of current dir or to precedent level of
dir. A common operation is to hit C-z and then return immediately where
you were with C-. instead of erasing minibuffer input with DEL. On
non-graphic displays, it is bound to C-l. If `helm-ff-lynx-style-map`
is non–nil, you will be able to use `left` instead of C-l and `right`
instead of C-z.

## Jump with nth commands

 Take advantage of the second, third and 4th actions
in helm. Instead of opening action menu with TAB, just hit:

`C-e` for 2th action
`C-j` for 3th action

You can bind 4th action to some key like this:

    (define-key helm-map (kbd "<C-tab>") 'helm-select-4th-action)

## Helm find files action shortcuts

 Instead of having to open action pannel with
TAB, you have some convenients shortcuts to quickly run actions. Use C-c
? from an helm-find-files session to have a description.

## Turn in image viewer

 You can turn helm-find-files in a nice
image-viewer.

Navigate to your image directory, then type C-u C-z on first image. Now
turn on `follow-mode` with C-c C-f. You can now navigate in your image
directory with arrow up and down or C-n C-p. Don`t forget also to use
C-t to split you windows vertically if needed.

You will find also two actions to rotate image in action menu. To use
these actions whitout quitting, use M-l (rotate left) and M-r (rotate
right). Of course M-l and M-r have no effect if candidate is not an
image file.

Don`t forget to use C-t to split windows vertically, and then

    `C-}' and `C-{'

to narrow/enlarge helm window.

NOTE: It use image-dired in background, so if image-dired doesn't work for
some reason, this will not work too. Be sure to have Imagemagick package
installed.

## Serial rename

 You can rename files with a new prefix name and by
incremental number. The marked files will be renamed with a new prefix
name and starting at the start-number you have chosen.
 Note that the marked files are in the order of the selection you did,
this allows you to reorder files.
 If you mark files in other directories than the current one, these
files will be moved or symlinked to current one.

TIP: If you have more than 100 files to serial rename, start at 100
instead of 1 to have your directory sorted correctly.

You have three ways to serial rename:

-   By renaming: All the file of others directories are moved to the target
    directory.

-   By symlinking: All the files that are not files of the target
    directory will be symlinked, others will be renamed.

-   By copying: All the file of others directories are copied to
    target directory.

Example of Use:
 I want to create a directory with many symlinked images coming from
various directories.

1) C-x C-f (launch helm-find-files)

2) Navigate to the place of your choice and write new directory name
    ending with `/` and press RET.

3) Navigate and browse images, when you want an image mark it, you can
    mark all in a directory with M-a.

4) When you have marked all files, choose `serial rename by symlinking`
    in action menu.

5) Choose new name and start number.

6) Navigate to initial directory (where files will be
    renamed/symlinked) and RET.

7) Say yes to confirm, that`s done.

8) Start viewing your pictures.

## Open Files Externally

 In action menu of helm-find-files, you will find an action to open
a file with an external program. If you have no entry in .mailcap or
/etc/mailcap, you will enter an helm session to choose a program to
use with this kind of file. It will offer to you to save settings to
always open this kind of files with this program. Once configured, you
can however open the files of same extension with some other program
by forcing helm to choose program with C-u.

NOTE: You can open files externally with `C-c C-x` from
helm-find-files.

## Eshell command on files

 You can run eshell-command on files or marked files, the command you
use has to accept one file as argument. The completion is made on
your eshell aliases. This allow you creating personal actions for
`helm-find-files`.

## Why Eshell

-   Because eshell allow you to create aliases.

-   Because eshell accept shell commands but also elisp functions.

All these command should end with `https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/issues/495`.

You will have completion against all these aliases once eshell is loaded (start it once before using
helm-find-files).

## Setup Aliases

 Go in eshell, an enter at prompt:

    alias my_alias command https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/issues/495

NOTE: don`t forget to escape the $.

See the documentation of Eshell for more info.

## Problem starting Eshell

 Eshell code is available (autoloaded) only when you have started once
eshell. That`s annoying like many autoloaded stuff in Emacs.

Here how to start Eshell at Emacs startup:

Add this to your `init.el`:

    (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook #'(lambda ()
                                      (let ((default-directory (getenv "HOME")))
                                        (command-execute 'eshell)
                                        (bury-buffer))))

## Copy Files

 It is a powerful feature of helm-find-files as you can
mark files in very different places in your file system and copy them in
one place.

Dired is not able to do that, you can mark files only in current dired
display and copy them somewhere.

So, easy to use, just mark some files, and hit copy files in the action
menu. That will open a new helm-find-files where you can choose
destination.

## Rename Files

Just mark some files, and
hit rename files in the action menu. That will open a new
helm-find-files where you can choose destination.

## Symlink Files

Just mark some files, and hit symlink or relsymlink
files in the action menu. That will open a new helm-find-files where you
can choose destination.

## Hardlink

Just mark some files,
and hit hardlink files in the action menu. That will open a new
helm-find-files where you can choose destination.

## Follow file after action

 A prefix arg on any of the action above, copy,
rename, symlink, hardlink, will allow you to follow the file. For
example, when you want to copy an elisp file somewhere and you want to
compile it in this place, hitting C-u RET will bring you in this place
with the file already marked, you have just to go in action menu to
compile it.

## In Buffer File Completion

 In any buffer and even in minibuffer if you have
enabled recursive-minibuffer

    (setq enable-recursive-minibuffers t)

You can have completion with C-x C-f and then hit tab to choose action
`Complete at point`
 once you have found the filename you want. `Create File`
 Navigate to the directory where you want to create
your new file, then
 continue typing the name of your file and type enter.
 NOTE: If your filename ends with a / you will be prompt to create a new
directory.

## Create Directory

 Navigate to the directory where you want to
create your new directory,
 then continue typing the name of new directory - parents accepted -
 and end it with / type enter, you will be prompt to create your new
directory (possibly with parents).

## Ediff files

 Well, that is easy to use, move cursor to a file, hit
ediff in action menu, you will jump in another helm-find-files to choose
second file.

## Ediff merge files
move cursor to a file, hit ediff merge in action menu, you will jump in another
helm-find-files to choose second file.

## Browse archive with avfs

If you have installed avfs (See: http://sourceforge.net/projects/avf)
you can browse archives in your directory .avfs once it is mounted with
`mountavfs`.

Just move on the archive filename and press C-z (persistent action) and
you will see in helm buffer the subdirectories of archive, just navigate
inside as usual.

## Helm write buffer

 That is a replacement of standard `write-buffer`
Emacs command with helm completion.

## Helm insert file

 That is a replacement of standard `insert-file`
Emacs command with helm completion.

# Grep

 We describe here helm-do-grep, an incremental grep. It is
really convenient as you can start a search just after finding the directories
or files you want to search in. By the nature of incremental stuff, it
is faster than original Emacs grep for searching.

As you type the display changes (like in all other helm commands). This
grep is also recursive unlike the Emacs implementation that use
find/xargs.

It supports wildcards and respects the variables `grep-find-ignored-files`
and `grep-find-ignored-directories`.

It has full tramp integration. (you can grep file on a remote host or
in su/sudo methods).

-   NOTE: When using it recursively, `grep-find-ignored-files` is not
    used unless you don`t specify the only extensions of files where you
    want to search (you will have a prompt). You can now specify more
    than one extension to search.
     e.g \*.el \*.py \*.tex
     will search only in files with these extensions.

-   NOTE: Windows users need grep version `2.5.4` of Gnuwin32 on windoze.
This version should accept the `--exclude-dir` option.

-   NOTE: Apple OS X users also need a version of grep that accepts `--exclude-dir`

    Install it from homebrew with:

         brew install grep

## Helm do grep

 Start with M-x helm-do-grep bound to `helm-command-prefix-key` `M-g s` (A prefix arg will launch recursive grep).

## Grep from helm-find-files

 From helm-find-files (`helm-command-prefix-key` `C-x C-f`) Open the action
menu with tab and choose grep. A prefix arg will launch recursive grep.

-   NOTE:You can now launch grep with (C-u) M-g s without switching to
    the action pannel.

## Grep One file

 Just launch grep, it will search in file at point.
if file is a directory, it will search in ALL files of this directory
like:

    grep -nH -e pattern *

## Grep Marked files

 Just mark some files with

    C-<SPACE>

and launch grep.

## Grep marked files from differents directories

This is a very nice feature of helm grep implementation that allows to search
in specific files located not only in current directory but anywhere in your file system.

To use navigate in your file system and mark files with

    C-<SPACE>

When you have marked all files, just launch grep in action menu.

NOTE: Using prefix-arg (C-u) will start a recursive search with the
extensions of the marked files except if those are one of
`grep-find-ignored-files`.

## Grep Directory recursively

 From `helm-find-files`, go to the root of the
directory where you want to search in, then hit TAB to open the action
menu and choose grep with a prefix arg (i.e C-u RET).

If you want to launch helm-do-grep recursively without starting `helm-find-files`, do:

    C-u helm-command-prefix-key M-g s

NOTE: If you forget to hit `C-u` before `M-g s` you can do it after file selection.

You will be prompted for selecting in which category of files to search:
Use the wilcard syntax like \*.el for example (search in only `.el`
files).

By default, the extension of the file at point is used when the cursor
is on a filename. If the cursor is at root of a directory, all the
filename extensions found in the directory and not matching
`grep-find-ignored-files` are inserted into the prompt.

## Grep Using Wildcard

+ You can use wildcards: If you want for example to search files with
+.el extension: add \*.el to prompt.

## Grep thing at point

 Before lauching helm, put your cursor on the start
of symbol or sexp you will want to grep. Then launch helm-do-grep or
helm-find-files, and when in the grep prompt hit C-w as many time as
needed.

## Grep persistent action

 As always, C-z will bring you in the buffer corresponding to the file
you are grepping. Well nothing new, but using C-u C-z will record this
place in the mark-ring. So if you want to come back later to these
places, there is no need to grep again, you will find all these places
in the mark-ring. Accessing the mark-ring in Emacs is really
inconvenient, fortunately, you will find in helm-config
`helm-all-mark-ring` which is a mark-ring browser
(helm-command-prefix-key C-c SPACE). `helm-all-mark-ring` is in helm
menu also, in the tool section.

-   TIP: Bind `helm-all-mark-ring` to C-c SPACE.

        (global-set-key (kbd "C-c <SPC>") 'helm-all-mark-rings)

-   NOTE: `helm-all-mark-ring` handle global-mark-ring also.

## Save grep session

 If you want to save the results of your grep
session, doing `C-x C-s` will save your grep results in a `helm-grep-mode` buffer.

_NOTE:_ You can save differents named helm grep buffers.
      If you haven't saved your grep session in a named buffer, you can anyway retrieve
      the last session with `helm-resume`.

Editing the `helm-grep-mode` buffer is possible with [Emacs-wgrep](https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep).
Saving this buffer will apply changes to corresponding files.

# Helm M-x

 It is bound to `helm-command-prefix-key` `M-x`, you should bind it to `M-x`.

Features:

-   You can use prefix arguments during M-x session and they are shown in `mode-line`.

-   C-z is a toggle documentation for this command

-   The key binding of command are shown.

-   Smart sorting.

_NOTE:_Prefix args passed before calling `helm-M-x` have no effects.
Passing the prefix args AFTER calling `helm-M-x` allow you to read the documentation
of the command you want to run and know exactly what effect they have.

# Helm regexp

 This is a replacement of regexp-builder. The groups
are shown in a convenient way.

# Query replace regexp

 Write your regexp in helm-regexp, when it
match what you want, you can run query-replace from action menu. NOTE:
Before running helm-regexp, you can select a region to work in, that
will narrow this region automatically. {Save regexp as sexp}
 When you use this, it will save your regexp for
further use in lisp code, with backslash duplicated.

## Save regexp as string

 Save the regexp as you write it.

# Helm locate

 First be sure you have `locate` installed on
your system. Most GNU/Linux distros come with locate included, you update
or create the database with `updatedb` command.

## Search files

To use, just launch

    M-x helm-locate

Then enter filename at prompt. It will search this pattern entered
also in directory and subdirectory names. To limit your search to
basename, add `-b` after the pattern. The search is performed on all
files known to the database. They maybe not exist anymore, so to
limit to really existing files add `-e` after the pattern. To limit your
search to specific number of results, use `-n` after your pattern with
the number of results you want.

Example:

    Pattern: emacs -b -e -n 12

You can also launch `helm-locate` from `helm-find-files`, just do `C-x C-f`.
(With a prefix arg it will let you choose a local DB file)

## Launch grep

When the search is done, you can search in a specific file or directory with
grep that you will find in action menu (TAB).

-   NOTE:You can now launch grep with (C-u) M-g s without switching to
    the action pannel.

## Use a local locate DB

You can specify a `locate` database with prefix argument ARG (C-u). Many
databases can be used: navigate and mark them. See also
`helm-locate-with-db`.

To create a user specific db, use:

    updatedb -l 0 -o dbpath -U directory

Where `dbpath` is a filename matched by `helm-locate-db-file-regexp`

## Windows specificity

On Windows you should use Everything program that mimics locate, it is very
fast and you don't need to update database manually. To use with
helm-locate, you will need his command line named `es`. Be sure to
modify the PATH environment variable, to include path to the directory
that contain `es`.

# Helm Etags

## Create the tag file

To use etags in Emacs you have first to create a TAGS file for your
project with the etags shell command. If your directory contains
subdirectories use someting like:(e.g .el files)

    find . -iregex .*\.el$ | xargs etags

Otherwise

    etags *.el

is enough.

For more infos see the man page of etags.

## Start helm etags

Now just using `helm-command-prefix-key` `e` will show you all
entries. If the project is big, It take some time to load tag file.
But when it is done, the next search will be very fast. If you modify
the TAGS file, use

    C-u C-u helm-command-prefix-key e

to refresh the tag cache.

To search the definition at point use just

    C-u helm-command-prefix-key e

# Firefox bookmarks

You will have to set firefox to import bookmarks in his html file
book-marks.html.

    (only for firefox versions >=3)

To achieve that, open `about:config` in firefox and double click on this
line to enable value to true :

    user_pref("browser.bookmarks.autoExportHTML", false);

You should have now :

    user_pref("browser.bookmarks.autoExportHTML", true);

Now you can use

    M-x helm-firefox-bookmarks

To see your firefox bookmarks from Emacs. When you are in firefox, things
are a little more complicated. You will need wmctrl program and a script
named ffbookmarks :

    #!/bin/bash

    wmctrl -xa emacs
    emacsclient -e "(progn (helm-firefox-bookmarks) nil)" > /dev/null
    wmctrl -xa firefox
    exit 0

Put this script somewhere in PATH and make it executable :

    chmod +x ffbookmarks

Firefox is not aware about this new protocol, you will have to instruct
it. See Firefox documentation or use firefox-protocol.el package you can
get here:
 <https://github.com/thierryvolpiatto/emacs-bmk-ext>
 Install ffbookmarks:

    M-x firefox-protocol-installer-install

Then install a bookmarklet in firefox: Right click on the bookmark
toolbar in firefox and add a new bookmark called ffbookmarks. Add this
instead of url:

    javascript:location.href='ffbookmarks://localhost'

Now when you click on ffbookmarks it will bring you in Emacs and allow
you to browse your bookmarks with helm.
 NOTE : Emacs server needs to be started in the running Emacs, see Emacs
documentation.

# Helm for buffers

    M-x helm-buffers-list

## Boring buffers

This will show you your buffer list without boring buffers, which are
defined in `helm-c-boring-buffer-regexp`. Use customize as usual.

## Search buffers by major-mode

Once in the helm session, you can narrow your buffer list by
`major-mode`, regexp as usual or both:

Example:

I want to show all my buffer that are in emacs-lisp mode:

    Pattern: *lisp

will show all emacs-lisp and lisp related buffers.

Now I want to limit these buffers to the one that start with `helm`

    Pattern: *lisp ^helm

Now I want to limit these buffers to the one that match `helm` but end with `foo`:

    Pattern: *lisp helm foo

Note the space between `helm` and `foo`.

Now match buffers that are in `emacs-lisp-mode` and `sh-mode` or `shell-mode`:

    Pattern: *lisp,sh

You can use also negation to match all but `lisp` and `info` buffers:

    Pattern: *!lisp,!info

I want to match buffers that match `helm` but not limited to lisp
buffers:

    Pattern: helm

## Different colors for buffers

-   If a buffer is modified, it will show up in orange.

-   If a buffer have been modified by some external program (e.g sed) in
    the back of Emacs, it will show up in red.

-   Non–buffer file, Directory and files have differents face.

# Special commands

 Not complete.

`C-c ?` will show you all commands available.

# Helm Resume

You can resume an helm session at any moment.

When called with a prefix arg allow choosing among different sessions.

# Other tools

In addition to the above, you will find a bunch of powerful tools that
come with helm-config.el. Just browse the available helm commands with
`M-x` `helm-`.

Not complete.

# Helm mode

 `helm-mode` will enable
helm completion in all Emacs commands using `completing-read` or `read-file-name`.

Starting with emacs-24.4 `helm-mode` provide also completion with `completion-at-point`
and `completing-read-multiple`.

 To use it:

    M-x helm-mode

Turn it on in `init.el` with:

    (helm-mode 1)

## Customize how helm-mode behave

You can disable or change the completion interface you want to use for a specific command by
customizing `helm-completing-read-handlers-alist`.

See C-h v `helm-completing-read-handlers-alist` for more infos.

### Use helm-mode and ido-mode

If you like ido for some commands and helm for other commands, you should not enable `ido-mode`,
instead customize `helm-completing-read-handlers-alist`; For example, you want `ido-mode`
for `find-file-read-only` and `helm-mode` for `find-file`:
1) In your config you turn on `helm-mode`.
2) In customize-group `helm-mode` add to `helm-completing-read-handlers-alist`
`find-file-read-only` as key and `ido` as value.
In elisp it looks like this:
     (find-file-read-only . ido)

That's it, now `find-file-read-only` is now using ido an `find-file` (because you did nothing)
is using `helm-mode`.

Now you want `find-alternate-file` to not use ido and to not use helm, only the vanilla emacs
completion:
Add an entry to `helm-completing-read-handlers-alist` like this:
     (find-alternate-file . nil)

_NOTE:_
Even if `helm-mode` is enabling helm completion for most emacs commands, you have better time
to use a native helm command which will be more featured, if this one is provided.
(e.g use `helm-M-x` for `M-x` even if enabling `helm-mode` provide helm completion in regular emacs `M-x`.)

Not complete.

# Helm Eshell completion

## Enable helm pcomplete

Of course pcomplete is already enabled in Eshell, but what we want here
is to enable it with helm support.
 Enabling is easy, just add to `init.el`:

>     (add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook
>               #'(lambda ()
>                   (define-key eshell-mode-map
>                     [remap eshell-pcomplete]
>                     'helm-esh-pcomplete)))

Now when hitting `TAB`, you should have helm pcompletion.

## Fix completion after SUDO.

In eshell when you use sudo, there is no completion on the command you enter
after sudo, this is true in shell also with or without helm.
To fix this problem, you can define a `pcomplete/sudo`  function and put it in your configuration.

    (defun pcomplete/sudo ()
      (let ((prec (pcomplete-arg 'last -1)))
        (cond ((string= "sudo" prec)
               (while (pcomplete-here*
                        (funcall pcomplete-command-completion-function)
                        (pcomplete-arg 'last) t))))))


However this an incomplete definition of `pcomplete/sudo` which will not work in some case
without modifications to some emacs functions due to bugs unresolved in emacs, to fix this
you can use my [pcomplete-extension](https://github.com/thierryvolpiatto/pcomplete-extension)
which will provide more completions working well with helm like `apt-get` or `find`.

## Write your own pcomplete functions

You can enhance Emacs pcomplete by writing your own pcomplete
functions.

See [pcomplete-extension](https://github.com/thierryvolpiatto/pcomplete-extension)
For more enhanced completions.

 Here an example with `find` command:

    (defun pcomplete/find ()
      (let ((prec (pcomplete-arg 'last -1)))
        (cond ((and (pcomplete-match "^-" 'last)
                    (string= "find" prec))
               (pcomplete-opt "HLPDO"))
              ((pcomplete-match "^-" 'last)
               (while (pcomplete-here
                       '("-amin" "-anewer" "-atime" "-cmin" "-cnewer" "-context"
                         "-ctime" "-daystart" "-delete" "-depth" "-empty" "-exec"
                         "-execdir" "-executable" "-false" "-fls" "-follow" "-fprint"
                         "-fprint0" "-fprintf" "-fstype" "-gid" "-group"
                         "-help" "-ignore_readdir_race" "-ilname" "-iname"
                         "-inum" "-ipath" "-iregex" "-iwholename"
                         "-links" "-lname" "-ls" "-maxdepth"
                         "-mindepth" "-mmin" "-mount" "-mtime"
                         "-name" "-newer" "-nogroup" "-noignore_readdir_race"
                         "-noleaf" "-nouser" "-nowarn" "-ok"
                         "-okdir" "-path" "-perm" "-print"
                         "-print0" "-printf" "-prune" "-quit"
                         "-readable" "-regex" "-regextype" "-samefile"
                         "-size" "-true" "-type" "-uid"
                         "-used" "-user" "-version" "-warn"
                         "-wholename" "-writable" "-xdev" "-xtype"))))
              ((string= "-type" prec)
               (while (pcomplete-here (list "b" "c" "d" "p" "f" "l" "s" "D"))))
              ((string= "-xtype" prec)
               (while (pcomplete-here (list "b" "c" "d" "p" "f" "l" "s"))))
              ((or (string= prec "-exec")
                   (string= prec "-execdir"))
               (while (pcomplete-here* (funcall pcomplete-command-completion-function)
                                       (pcomplete-arg 'last) t))))
        (while (pcomplete-here (pcomplete-entries) nil 'identity))))

## Enable helm Eshell history

Add this to `init.el`

     (add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook
               #'(lambda ()
                   (define-key eshell-mode-map
                     (kbd "M-p")
                     'helm-eshell-history)))

# Completion in emacs shell

Completion in emacs `shell` is using `completion-at-point`, `helm-mode` provide completion for this
starting from emacs-24.4 and is not available in emacs-24.3.
Same as above, you should use [pcomplete-extension](https://github.com/thierryvolpiatto/pcomplete-extension)
to have a better experience.

# Usefuls extensions

If you are using git, I suggest you use [helm-ls-git](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm-ls-git)

Not complete.
