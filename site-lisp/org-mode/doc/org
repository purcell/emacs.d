1.1 Summary
===========

Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and doing
project planning with a fast and effective plain-text system.

   Org develops organizational tasks around NOTES files that contain
lists or information about projects as plain text.  Org is implemented
on top of Outline mode, which makes it possible to keep the content of
large files well structured.  Visibility cycling and structure editing
help to work with the tree.  Tables are easily created with a built-in
table editor.  Org supports TODO items, deadlines, timestamps, and
scheduling.  It dynamically compiles entries into an agenda that
utilizes and smoothly integrates much of the Emacs calendar and diary.
Plain text URL-like links connect to websites, emails, Usenet messages,
BBDB entries, and any files related to the projects.  For printing and
sharing notes, an Org file can be exported as a structured ASCII file,
as HTML, or (TODO and agenda items only) as an iCalendar file.  It can
also serve as a publishing tool for a set of linked web pages.

   As a project planning environment, Org works by adding metadata to
outline nodes.  Based on this data, specific entries can be extracted
in queries and create dynamic agenda views.

   Org mode contains the Org Babel environment which allows you to work
with embedded source code blocks in a file, to facilitate code
evaluation, documentation, and literate programming techniques.

   Org's automatic, context-sensitive table editor with spreadsheet
capabilities can be integrated into any major mode by activating the
minor Orgtbl mode.  Using a translation step, it can be used to maintain
tables in arbitrary file types, for example in LaTeX.  The structure
editing and list creation capabilities can be used outside Org with the
minor Orgstruct mode.

   Org keeps simple things simple.  When first fired up, it should feel
like a straightforward, easy to use outliner.  Complexity is not
imposed, but a large amount of functionality is available when you need
it.  Org is a toolbox and can be used in different ways and for
different ends, for example:

     * an outline extension with visibility cycling and structure editing
     * an ASCII system and table editor for taking structured notes
     * a TODO list editor
     * a full agenda and planner with deadlines and work scheduling
     * an environment in which to implement David Allen's GTD system
     * a simple hypertext system, with HTML and LaTeX export
     * a publishing tool to create a set of interlinked web pages
     * an environment for literate programming

   There is a website for Org which provides links to the newest
version of Org, as well as additional information, frequently asked
questions (FAQ), links to tutorials, etc.  This page is located at
`http://orgmode.org'.

   The version 7.3 of this manual is available as a paperback book from

File: org,  Node: Installation,  Next: Activation,  Prev: Summary,  Up: Introduction

1.2 Installation
================

Org is part of recent distributions of GNU Emacs, so you normally don't
need to install it.  If, for one reason or another, you want to install
Org on top of this pre-packaged version, there are three ways to do it:

   * By using Emacs package system.

   * By downloading Org as an archive.

   * By using Org's git repository.

   We strongly recommend to stick to a single installation method.

Using Emacs packaging system
............................

Recent Emacs distributions include a packaging system which lets you
install Elisp libraries.  You can install Org with `M-x package-install
RET org'.  You need to do this in a session where no `.org' file has
been visited.  Then, to make sure your Org configuration is taken into
account, initialize the package system with `(package-initialize)' in
your `.emacs' before setting any Org option.  If you want to use Org's
package repository, check out the Org ELPA page
(http://orgmode.org/elpa.html).

Downloading Org as an archive
.............................

You can download Org latest release from Org's website
(http://orgmode.org/).  In this case, make sure you set the load-path
correctly in your `.emacs':

     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/orgdir/lisp")

   The downloaded archive contains contributed libraries that are not
included in Emacs.  If you want to use them, add the `contrib'
directory to your load-path:

     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/orgdir/contrib/lisp" t)

   Optionally, you can compile the files and/or install them in your
system.  Run `make help' to list compilation and installation options.

Using Org's git repository
..........................

You can clone Org's repository and install Org like this:

     $ cd ~/src/
     $ git clone git://orgmode.org/org-mode.git
     $ make autoloads

   Note that in this case, `make autoloads' is mandatory: it defines
Org's version in `org-version.el' and Org's autoloads in
`org-loaddefs.el'.

   Remember to add the correct load-path as described in the method
above.

   You can also compile with `make', generate the documentation with
`make doc', create a local configuration with `make config' and install
Org with `make install'.  Please run `make help' to get the list of
compilation/installation options.

   For more detailed explanations on Org's build system, please check
the Org Build System page on Worg
(http://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-build-system.html).


File: org,  Node: Activation,  Next: Feedback,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Introduction

1.3 Activation
==============

Since Emacs 22.2, files with the `.org' extension use Org mode by
default.  If you are using an earlier version of Emacs, add this line
to your `.emacs' file:

     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.org\\'" . org-mode))

   Org mode buffers need font-lock to be turned on: this is the default
in Emacs(1).

   There are compatibility issues between Org mode and some other Elisp
packages, please take the time to check the list (*note Conflicts::).

   The four Org commands `org-store-link', `org-capture', `org-agenda',
and `org-iswitchb' should be accessible through global keys (i.e.,
anywhere in Emacs, not just in Org buffers).  Here are suggested
bindings for these keys, please modify the keys to your own liking.
     (global-set-key "\C-cl" 'org-store-link)
     (global-set-key "\C-cc" 'org-capture)
     (global-set-key "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)
     (global-set-key "\C-cb" 'org-iswitchb)

   With this setup, all files with extension `.org' will be put into
Org mode.  As an alternative, make the first line of a file look like
this:

     MY PROJECTS    -*- mode: org; -*-

which will select Org mode for this buffer no matter what the file's
name is.  See also the variable `org-insert-mode-line-in-empty-file'.

   Many commands in Org work on the region if the region is active.  To
make use of this, you need to have `transient-mark-mode'
(`zmacs-regions' in XEmacs) turned on.  In Emacs 23 this is the default,
in Emacs 22 you need to do this yourself with
     (transient-mark-mode 1)
   If you do not like `transient-mark-mode', you can create an active
region by using the mouse to select a region, or pressing `C-<SPC>'
twice before moving the cursor.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If you don't use font-lock globally, turn it on in Org buffer
with `(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock)'


File: org,  Node: Feedback,  Next: Conventions,  Prev: Activation,  Up: Introduction

1.4 Feedback
============

If you find problems with Org, or if you have questions, remarks, or
ideas about it, please mail to the Org mailing list
<emacs-orgmode@gnu.org>.  If you are not a member of the mailing list,
your mail will be passed to the list after a moderator has approved
it(1).

   For bug reports, please first try to reproduce the bug with the
latest version of Org available--if you are running an outdated
version, it is quite possible that the bug has been fixed already.  If
the bug persists, prepare a report and provide as much information as
possible, including the version information of Emacs (`M-x
emacs-version <RET>') and Org (`M-x org-version RET'), as well as the
Org related setup in `.emacs'.  The easiest way to do this is to use
the command
     M-x org-submit-bug-report RET
   which will put all this information into an Emacs mail buffer so
that you only need to add your description.  If you re not sending the
Email from within Emacs, please copy and paste the content into your
Email program.

   Sometimes you might face a problem due to an error in your Emacs or
Org mode setup.  Before reporting a bug, it is very helpful to start
Emacs with minimal customizations and reproduce the problem.  Doing so
often helps you determine if the problem is with your customization or
with Org mode itself.  You can start a typical minimal session with a
command like the example below.

     $ emacs -Q -l /path/to/minimal-org.el

   However if you are using Org mode as distributed with Emacs, a
minimal setup is not necessary.  In that case it is sufficient to start
Emacs as `emacs -Q'.  The `minimal-org.el' setup file can have contents
as shown below.

     ;;; Minimal setup to load latest `org-mode'

     ;; activate debugging
     (setq debug-on-error t
           debug-on-signal nil
           debug-on-quit nil)

     ;; add latest org-mode to load path
     (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "/path/to/org-mode/lisp"))
     (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "/path/to/org-mode/contrib/lisp" t))

   If an error occurs, a backtrace can be very useful (see below on how
to create one).  Often a small example file helps, along with clear
information about:

  1. What exactly did you do?

  2. What did you expect to happen?

  3. What happened instead?
        Thank you for helping to improve this program.

How to create a useful backtrace
................................

If working with Org produces an error with a message you don't
understand, you may have hit a bug.  The best way to report this is by
providing, in addition to what was mentioned above, a _backtrace_.
This is information from the built-in debugger about where and how the
error occurred.  Here is how to produce a useful backtrace:

  1. Reload uncompiled versions of all Org mode Lisp files.  The
     backtrace contains much more information if it is produced with
     uncompiled code.  To do this, use
          C-u M-x org-reload RET
     or select `Org -> Refresh/Reload -> Reload Org uncompiled' from the
     menu.

  2. Go to the `Options' menu and select `Enter Debugger on Error'
     (XEmacs has this option in the `Troubleshooting' sub-menu).

  3. Do whatever you have to do to hit the error.  Don't forget to
     document the steps you take.

  4. When you hit the error, a `*Backtrace*' buffer will appear on the
     screen.  Save this buffer to a file (for example using `C-x C-w')
     and attach it to your bug report.

File: org,  Node: Conventions,  Prev: Feedback,  Up: Introduction

1.5 Typesetting conventions used in this manual
===============================================

TODO keywords, tags, properties, etc.
.....................................

Org mainly uses three types of keywords: TODO keywords, tags and
property names.  In this manual we use the following conventions:

`TODO'
`WAITING'
     TODO keywords are written with all capitals, even if they are
     user-defined.

`boss'
`ARCHIVE'
     User-defined tags are written in lowercase; built-in tags with
     special meaning are written with all capitals.

`Release'
`PRIORITY'
     User-defined properties are capitalized; built-in properties with
     special meaning are written with all capitals.

   Moreover, Org uses option keywords (like `#+TITLE' to set the title)
and environment keywords (like `#+BEGIN_HTML' to start a `HTML'
environment).  They are written in uppercase in the manual to enhance
its readability, but you can use lowercase in your Org files(1).

Keybindings and commands
........................

The manual suggests two global keybindings: `C-c a' for `org-agenda'
and `C-c c' for `org-capture'.  These are only suggestions, but the
rest of the manual assumes that you are using these keybindings.

   Also, the manual lists both the keys and the corresponding commands
for accessing a functionality.  Org mode often uses the same key for
different functions, depending on context.  The command that is bound
to such keys has a generic name, like `org-metaright'.  In the manual
we will, wherever possible, give the function that is internally called
by the generic command.  For example, in the chapter on document
structure, `M-<right>' will be listed to call `org-do-demote', while in
the chapter on tables, it will be listed to call
`org-table-move-column-right'.  If you prefer, you can compile the
manual without the command names by unsetting the flag `cmdnames' in
`org.texi'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Easy templates insert lowercase keywords and Babel dynamically
inserts `#+results'.

2.1 Outlines
============

Org is implemented on top of Outline mode.  Outlines allow a document
to be organized in a hierarchical structure, which (at least for me) is
the best representation of notes and thoughts.  An overview of this
structure is achieved by folding (hiding) large parts of the document
to show only the general document structure and the parts currently
being worked on.  Org greatly simplifies the use of outlines by
compressing the entire show/hide functionality into a single command,
`org-cycle', which is bound to the <TAB> key.


File: org,  Node: Headlines,  Next: Visibility cycling,  Prev: Outlines,  Up: Document Structure

2.2 Headlines
=============

Headlines define the structure of an outline tree.  The headlines in Org
start with one or more stars, on the left margin(1) (2).  For example:

     * Top level headline
     ** Second level
     *** 3rd level
         some text
     *** 3rd level
         more text

     * Another top level headline

Some people find the many stars too noisy and would prefer an outline
that has whitespace followed by a single star as headline starters.
*note Clean view::, describes a setup to realize this.

   An empty line after the end of a subtree is considered part of it and
will be hidden when the subtree is folded.  However, if you leave at
least two empty lines, one empty line will remain visible after folding
the subtree, in order to structure the collapsed view.  See the
variable `org-cycle-separator-lines' to modify this behavior.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See the variables `org-special-ctrl-a/e', `org-special-ctrl-k',
and `org-ctrl-k-protect-subtree' to configure special behavior of `C-a',
`C-e', and `C-k' in headlines.

   (2) Clocking only works with headings indented less then 30 stars.

File: org,  Node: Global and local cycling,  Next: Initial visibility,  Prev: Visibility cycling,  Up: Visibility cycling

2.3.1 Global and local cycling
------------------------------

Outlines make it possible to hide parts of the text in the buffer.  Org
uses just two commands, bound to <TAB> and `S-<TAB>' to change the
visibility in the buffer.

`<TAB>'     (`org-cycle')
     _Subtree cycling_: Rotate current subtree among the states

          ,-> FOLDED -> CHILDREN -> SUBTREE --.
          '-----------------------------------'

     The cursor must be on a headline for this to work(1).  When the
     cursor is at the beginning of the buffer and the first line is not
     a headline, then <TAB> actually runs global cycling (see
     below)(2).  Also when called with a prefix argument (`C-u <TAB>'),
     global cycling is invoked.

`S-<TAB>'     (`org-global-cycle')
C-u <TAB>
     _Global cycling_: Rotate the entire buffer among the states

          ,-> OVERVIEW -> CONTENTS -> SHOW ALL --.
          '--------------------------------------'

     When `S-<TAB>' is called with a numeric prefix argument N, the
     CONTENTS view up to headlines of level N will be shown.  Note that
     inside tables, `S-<TAB>' jumps to the previous field.

`C-u C-u <TAB>'     (`org-set-startup-visibility')
     Switch back to the startup visibility of the buffer (*note Initial
     visibility::).  

`C-u C-u C-u <TAB>'     (`show-all')
     Show all, including drawers.  

`C-c C-r'     (`org-reveal')
     Reveal context around point, showing the current entry, the
     following heading and the hierarchy above.  Useful for working
     near a location that has been exposed by a sparse tree command
     (*note Sparse trees::) or an agenda command (*note Agenda
     commands::).  With a prefix argument show, on each level, all
     sibling headings.  With a double prefix argument, also show the
     entire subtree of the parent.  

`C-c C-k'     (`show-branches')
     Expose all the headings of the subtree, CONTENT view for just one
     subtree.  

`C-c <TAB>'     (`show-children')
     Expose all direct children of the subtree.  With a numeric prefix
     argument N, expose all children down to level N.  

`C-c C-x b'     (`org-tree-to-indirect-buffer')
     Show the current subtree in an indirect buffer(3).  With a numeric
     prefix argument N, go up to level N and then take that tree.  If N
     is negative then go up that many levels.  With a `C-u' prefix, do
     not remove the previously used indirect buffer.  

`C-c C-x v'     (`org-copy-visible')
     Copy the visible text in the region into the kill ring.

* Menu:

* Initial visibility::          Setting the initial visibility state
* Catching invisible edits::    Preventing mistakes when editing invisible parts

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) see, however, the option `org-cycle-emulate-tab'.

   (2) see the option `org-cycle-global-at-bob'.

   (3) The indirect buffer (*note Indirect Buffers: (emacs)Indirect
Buffers.)  will contain the entire buffer, but will be narrowed to the
current tree.  Editing the indirect buffer will also change the
original buffer, but without affecting visibility in that buffer.


File: org,  Node: Initial visibility,  Next: Catching invisible edits,  Prev: Global and local cycling,  Up: Visibility cycling

2.3.2 Initial visibility
------------------------

When Emacs first visits an Org file, the global state is set to
OVERVIEW, i.e., only the top level headlines are visible(1)  This can
be configured through the variable `org-startup-folded', or on a
per-file basis by adding one of the following lines anywhere in the
buffer:

     #+STARTUP: overview
     #+STARTUP: content
     #+STARTUP: showall
     #+STARTUP: showeverything

   The startup visibility options are ignored when the file is open for
the first time during the agenda generation: if you want the agenda to
honor the startup visibility, set `org-agenda-inhibit-startup' to `nil'.

Furthermore, any entries with a `VISIBILITY' property (*note Properties
and Columns::) will get their visibility adapted accordingly.  Allowed
values for this property are `folded', `children', `content', and `all'.

`C-u C-u <TAB>'     (`org-set-startup-visibility')
     Switch back to the startup visibility of the buffer, i.e.,
     whatever is requested by startup options and `VISIBILITY'
     properties in individual entries.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) When `org-agenda-inhibit-startup' is non-`nil', Org will not
honor the default visibility state when first opening a file for the
agenda (*note Speeding up your agendas::).


File: org,  Node: Catching invisible edits,  Prev: Initial visibility,  Up: Visibility cycling

2.3.3 Catching invisible edits
------------------------------

Sometimes you may inadvertently edit an invisible part of the buffer
and be confused on what has been edited and how to undo the mistake.
Setting `org-catch-invisible-edits' to non-`nil' will help prevent
this.  See the docstring of this option on how Org should catch
invisible edits and process them.


File: org,  Node: Motion,  Next: Structure editing,  Prev: Visibility cycling,  Up: Document Structure

2.4 Motion
==========

The following commands jump to other headlines in the buffer.

`C-c C-n'     (`outline-next-visible-heading')
     Next heading.  

`C-c C-p'     (`outline-previous-visible-heading')
     Previous heading.  

`C-c C-f'     (`org-forward-same-level')
     Next heading same level.  

`C-c C-b'     (`org-backward-same-level')
     Previous heading same level.  

`C-c C-u'     (`outline-up-heading')
     Backward to higher level heading.  

`C-c C-j'     (`org-goto')
     Jump to a different place without changing the current outline
     visibility.  Shows the document structure in a temporary buffer,
     where you can use the following keys to find your destination: 
          <TAB>         Cycle visibility.
          <down> / <up>   Next/previous visible headline.
          <RET>         Select this location.
          /           Do a Sparse-tree search
          The following keys work if you turn off `org-goto-auto-isearch'
          n / p        Next/previous visible headline.
          f / b        Next/previous headline same level.
          u            One level up.
          0-9          Digit argument.
          q            Quit
     See also the option `org-goto-interface'.


File: org,  Node: Structure editing,  Next: Sparse trees,  Prev: Motion,  Up: Document Structure

2.5 Structure editing
=====================

`M-<RET>'     (`org-insert-heading')
     Insert a new heading/item with the same level than the one at
     point.  If the cursor is in a plain list item, a new item is
     created (*note Plain lists::).  To prevent this behavior in lists,
     call the command with a prefix argument.  When this command is
     used in the middle of a line, the line is split and the rest of
     the line becomes the new item or headline(1).  If the command is
     used at the _beginning_ of a headline, the new headline is created
     before the current line.  If the command is used at the _end_ of a
     folded subtree (i.e., behind the ellipses at the end of a
     headline), then a headline will be inserted after the end of the
     subtree.  Calling this command with `C-u C-u' will unconditionally
     respect the headline's content and create a new item at the end of
     the parent subtree.  

`C-<RET>'     (`org-insert-heading-respect-content')
     Just like `M-<RET>', except when adding a new heading below the
     current heading, the new heading is placed after the body instead
     of before it.  This command works from anywhere in the entry.  

`M-S-<RET>'     (`org-insert-todo-heading')
     Insert new TODO entry with same level as current heading.  See
     also the variable `org-treat-insert-todo-heading-as-state-change'.  

`C-S-<RET>'     (`org-insert-todo-heading-respect-content')
     Insert new TODO entry with same level as current heading.  Like
     `C-<RET>', the new headline will be inserted after the current
     subtree.  

`<TAB>'     (`org-cycle')
     In a new entry with no text yet, the first <TAB> demotes the entry
     to become a child of the previous one.  The next <TAB> makes it a
     parent, and so on, all the way to top level.  Yet another <TAB>,
     and you are back to the initial level.  

`M-<left>'     (`org-do-promote')
     Promote current heading by one level.  

`M-<right>'     (`org-do-demote')
     Demote current heading by one level.  

`M-S-<left>'     (`org-promote-subtree')
     Promote the current subtree by one level.  

`M-S-<right>'     (`org-demote-subtree')
     Demote the current subtree by one level.  

`M-S-<up>'     (`org-move-subtree-up')
     Move subtree up (swap with previous subtree of same level).  

`M-S-<down>'     (`org-move-subtree-down')
     Move subtree down (swap with next subtree of same level).  

`M-h'     (`org-mark-element')
     Mark the element at point.  Hitting repeatedly will mark
     subsequent elements of the one just marked.  E.g., hitting <M-h>
     on a paragraph will mark it, hitting <M-h> immediately again will
     mark the next one.  

`C-c @'     (`org-mark-subtree')
     Mark the subtree at point.  Hitting repeatedly will mark
     subsequent subtrees of the same level than the marked subtree.  

`C-c C-x C-w'     (`org-cut-subtree')
     Kill subtree, i.e., remove it from buffer but save in kill ring.
     With a numeric prefix argument N, kill N sequential subtrees.  

`C-c C-x M-w'     (`org-copy-subtree')
     Copy subtree to kill ring.  With a numeric prefix argument N, copy
     the N sequential subtrees.  

`C-c C-x C-y'     (`org-paste-subtree')
     Yank subtree from kill ring.  This does modify the level of the
     subtree to make sure the tree fits in nicely at the yank position.
     The yank level can also be specified with a numeric prefix
     argument, or by yanking after a headline marker like `****'.  

`C-y'     (`org-yank')
     Depending on the options `org-yank-adjusted-subtrees' and
     `org-yank-folded-subtrees', Org's internal `yank' command will
     paste subtrees folded and in a clever way, using the same command
     as `C-c C-x C-y'.  With the default settings, no level adjustment
     will take place, but the yanked tree will be folded unless doing
     so would swallow text previously visible.  Any prefix argument to
     this command will force a normal `yank' to be executed, with the
     prefix passed along.  A good way to force a normal yank is `C-u
     C-y'.  If you use `yank-pop' after a yank, it will yank previous
     kill items plainly, without adjustment and folding.  

`C-c C-x c'     (`org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift')
     Clone a subtree by making a number of sibling copies of it.  You
     will be prompted for the number of copies to make, and you can
     also specify if any timestamps in the entry should be shifted.
     This can be useful, for example, to create a number of tasks
     related to a series of lectures to prepare.  For more details, see
     the docstring of the command `org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift'.  

`C-c C-w'     (`org-refile')
     Refile entry or region to a different location.  *Note Refile and
     copy::.  

`C-c ^'     (`org-sort')
     Sort same-level entries.  When there is an active region, all
     entries in the region will be sorted.  Otherwise the children of
     the current headline are sorted.  The command prompts for the
     sorting method, which can be alphabetically, numerically, by time
     (first timestamp with active preferred, creation time, scheduled
     time, deadline time), by priority, by TODO keyword (in the
     sequence the keywords have been defined in the setup) or by the
     value of a property.  Reverse sorting is possible as well.  You
     can also supply your own function to extract the sorting key.
     With a `C-u' prefix, sorting will be case-sensitive.  

`C-x n s'     (`org-narrow-to-subtree')
     Narrow buffer to current subtree.  

`C-x n b'     (`org-narrow-to-block')
     Narrow buffer to current block.  

`C-x n w'     (`widen')
     Widen buffer to remove narrowing.  

`C-c *'     (`org-toggle-heading')
     Turn a normal line or plain list item into a headline (so that it
     becomes a subheading at its location).  Also turn a headline into
     a normal line by removing the stars.  If there is an active
     region, turn all lines in the region into headlines.  If the first
     line in the region was an item, turn only the item lines into
     headlines.  Finally, if the first line is a headline, remove the
     stars from all headlines in the region.

   When there is an active region (Transient Mark mode), promotion and
demotion work on all headlines in the region.  To select a region of
headlines, it is best to place both point and mark at the beginning of a
line, mark at the beginning of the first headline, and point at the line
just after the last headline to change.  Note that when the cursor is
inside a table (*note Tables::), the Meta-Cursor keys have different
functionality.

`org-M-RET-may-split-line'.

2.6 Sparse trees
================

An important feature of Org mode is the ability to construct _sparse
trees_ for selected information in an outline tree, so that the entire
document is folded as much as possible, but the selected information is
made visible along with the headline structure above it(1).  Just try
it out and you will see immediately how it works.

   Org mode contains several commands creating such trees, all these
commands can be accessed through a dispatcher:

`C-c /'     (`org-sparse-tree')
     This prompts for an extra key to select a sparse-tree creating
     command.  

`C-c / r'     (`org-occur')
     Prompts for a regexp and shows a sparse tree with all matches.  If
     the match is in a headline, the headline is made visible.  If the
     match is in the body of an entry, headline and body are made
     visible.  In order to provide minimal context, also the full
     hierarchy of headlines above the match is shown, as well as the
     headline following the match.  Each match is also highlighted; the
     highlights disappear when the buffer is changed by an editing
     command(2), or by pressing `C-c C-c'.  When called with a `C-u'
     prefix argument, previous highlights are kept, so several calls to
     this command can be stacked.  

`M-g n'  or  `M-g M-n'     (`next-error')
     Jump to the next sparse tree match in this buffer.  

`M-g p'  or  `M-g M-p'     (`previous-error')
     Jump to the previous sparse tree match in this buffer.

For frequently used sparse trees of specific search strings, you can
use the option `org-agenda-custom-commands' to define fast keyboard
access to specific sparse trees.  These commands will then be
accessible through the agenda dispatcher (*note Agenda dispatcher::).
For example:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("f" occur-tree "FIXME")))

will define the key `C-c a f' as a shortcut for creating a sparse tree
matching the string `FIXME'.

   The other sparse tree commands select headings based on TODO
keywords, tags, or properties and will be discussed later in this
manual.

   To print a sparse tree, you can use the Emacs command
`ps-print-buffer-with-faces' which does not print invisible parts of
the document (3).  Or you can use `C-c C-e C-v' to export only the
visible part of the document and print the resulting file.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See also the variables `org-show-hierarchy-above',
`org-show-following-heading', `org-show-siblings', and
`org-show-entry-below' for detailed control on how much context is
shown around each match.

   (2) This depends on the option `org-remove-highlights-with-change'

   (3) This does not work under XEmacs, because XEmacs uses selective
display for outlining, not text properties.


File: org,  Node: Plain lists,  Next: Drawers,  Prev: Sparse trees,  Up: Document Structure

2.7 Plain lists
===============

Within an entry of the outline tree, hand-formatted lists can provide
additional structure.  They also provide a way to create lists of
checkboxes (*note Checkboxes::).  Org supports editing such lists, and
every exporter (*note Exporting::) can parse and format them.

   Org knows ordered lists, unordered lists, and description lists.
   * _Unordered_ list items start with `-', `+', or `*'(1)  as bullets.

   * _Ordered_ list items start with a numeral followed by either a
     period or a right parenthesis(2), such as `1.' or `1)'(3).  If you
     want a list to start with a different value (e.g., 20), start the
     text of the item with `[@20]'(4).  Those constructs can be used in
     any item of the list in order to enforce a particular numbering.

   * _Description_ list items are unordered list items, and contain the
     separator ` :: ' to distinguish the description _term_ from the
     description.

   Items belonging to the same list must have the same indentation on
the first line.  In particular, if an ordered list reaches number
`10.', then the 2-digit numbers must be written left-aligned with the
other numbers in the list.  An item ends before the next line that is
less or equally indented than its bullet/number.

   A list ends whenever every item has ended, which means before any
line less or equally indented than items at top level.  It also ends
before two blank lines(5).  In that case, all items are closed.  Here
is an example:

     ** Lord of the Rings
        My favorite scenes are (in this order)
        1. The attack of the Rohirrim
        2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
           + this was already my favorite scene in the book
           + I really like Miranda Otto.
        3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
           - on DVD only
           He makes a really funny face when it happens.
        But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
        Important actors in this film are:
        - Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo
        - Sean Austin :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.  I still remember
          him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in The Goonies.

   Org supports these lists by tuning filling and wrapping commands to
deal with them correctly(6), and by exporting them properly (*note
Exporting::).  Since indentation is what governs the structure of these
lists, many structural constructs like `#+BEGIN_...' blocks can be
indented to signal that they belong to a particular item.

   If you find that using a different bullet for a sub-list (than that
used for the current list-level) improves readability, customize the
variable `org-list-demote-modify-bullet'.  To get a greater difference
of indentation between items and theirs sub-items, customize
`org-list-indent-offset'.

   The following commands act on items when the cursor is in the first
line of an item (the line with the bullet or number).  Some of them
imply the application of automatic rules to keep list structure intact.
If some of these actions get in your way, configure
`org-list-automatic-rules' to disable them individually.

`<TAB>'     (`org-cycle')
     Items can be folded just like headline levels.  Normally this
     works only if the cursor is on a plain list item.  For more
     details, see the variable `org-cycle-include-plain-lists'.  If
     this variable is set to `integrate', plain list items will be
     treated like low-level headlines.  The level of an item is then
     given by the indentation of the bullet/number.  Items are always
     subordinate to real headlines, however; the hierarchies remain
     completely separated.  In a new item with no text yet, the first
     <TAB> demotes the item to become a child of the previous one.
     Subsequent <TAB>s move the item to meaningful levels in the list
     and eventually get it back to its initial position.  

`M-<RET>'     (`org-insert-heading')
     Insert new item at current level.  With a prefix argument, force a
     new heading (*note Structure editing::).  If this command is used
     in the middle of an item, that item is _split_ in two, and the
     second part becomes the new item(7).  If this command is executed
     _before item's body_, the new item is created _before_ the current
     one.

`M-S-<RET>'
     Insert a new item with a checkbox (*note Checkboxes::).  

`S-up'
`S-down'
     Jump to the previous/next item in the current list(8), but only if
     `org-support-shift-select' is off.  If not, you can still use
     paragraph jumping commands like `C-<up>' and `C-<down>' to quite
     similar effect.  

`M-up'
`M-down'
     Move the item including subitems up/down(9) (swap with
     previous/next item of same indentation).  If the list is ordered,
     renumbering is automatic.  

`M-left'
`M-right'
     Decrease/increase the indentation of an item, leaving children
     alone.  

`M-S-<left>'
`M-S-<right>'
     Decrease/increase the indentation of the item, including subitems.
     Initially, the item tree is selected based on current indentation.
     When these commands are executed several times in direct
     succession, the initially selected region is used, even if the new
     indentation would imply a different hierarchy.  To use the new
     hierarchy, break the command chain with a cursor motion or so.

     As a special case, using this command on the very first item of a
     list will move the whole list.  This behavior can be disabled by
     configuring `org-list-automatic-rules'.  The global indentation of
     a list has no influence on the text _after_ the list.  

`C-c C-c'
     If there is a checkbox (*note Checkboxes::) in the item line,
     toggle the state of the checkbox.  In any case, verify bullets and
     indentation consistency in the whole list.  

`C-c -'
     Cycle the entire list level through the different
     itemize/enumerate bullets (`-', `+', `*', `1.', `1)') or a subset
     of them, depending on `org-plain-list-ordered-item-terminator',
     the type of list, and its indentation.  With a numeric prefix
     argument N, select the Nth bullet from this list.  If there is an
     active region when calling this, selected text will be changed
     into an item.  With a prefix argument, all lines will be converted
     to list items.  If the first line already was a list item, any item
     marker will be removed from the list.  Finally, even without an
     active region, a normal line will be converted into a list item.  

`C-c *'
     Turn a plain list item into a headline (so that it becomes a
     subheading at its location).  *Note Structure editing::, for a
     detailed explanation.  

`C-c C-*'
     Turn the whole plain list into a subtree of the current heading.
     Checkboxes (*note Checkboxes::) will become TODO (resp. DONE)
     keywords when unchecked (resp. checked).  

`S-left/right'
     This command also cycles bullet styles when the cursor in on the
     bullet or anywhere in an item line, details depending on
     `org-support-shift-select'.  

`C-c ^'
     Sort the plain list.  You will be prompted for the sorting method:
     numerically, alphabetically, by time, by checked status for check
     lists, or by a custom function.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) When using `*' as a bullet, lines must be indented or they will
be seen as top-level headlines.  Also, when you are hiding leading
stars to get a clean outline view, plain list items starting with a
star may be hard to distinguish from true headlines.  In short: even
though `*' is supported, it may be better to not use it for plain list
items.

   (2) You can filter out any of them by configuring
`org-plain-list-ordered-item-terminator'.

   (3) You can also get `a.', `A.', `a)' and `A)' by configuring
`org-list-allow-alphabetical'.  To minimize confusion with normal text,
those are limited to one character only.  Beyond that limit, bullets
will automatically fallback to numbers.

   (4) If there's a checkbox in the item, the cookie must be put
_before_ the checkbox.  If you have activated alphabetical lists, you
can also use counters like `[@b]'.

   (5) See also `org-list-empty-line-terminates-plain-lists'.

   (6) Org only changes the filling settings for Emacs.  For XEmacs,
you should use Kyle E. Jones' `filladapt.el'.  To turn this on, put
into `.emacs': `(require 'filladapt)'

   (7) If you do not want the item to be split, customize the variable
`org-M-RET-may-split-line'.

   (8) If you want to cycle around items that way, you may customize
`org-list-use-circular-motion'.

   (9) See `org-list-use-circular-motion' for a cyclic behavior.


File: org,  Node: Drawers,  Next: Blocks,  Prev: Plain lists,  Up: Document Structure

2.8 Drawers
===========

Sometimes you want to keep information associated with an entry, but you
normally don't want to see it.  For this, Org mode has _drawers_.
Drawers need to be configured with the option `org-drawers'(1).
Drawers look like this:

     ** This is a headline
        Still outside the drawer
        :DRAWERNAME:
        This is inside the drawer.
        :END:
        After the drawer.

   You can interactively insert drawers at point by calling
`org-insert-drawer', which is bound to <C-c C-x d>.  With an active
region, this command will put the region inside the drawer.  With a
prefix argument, this command calls `org-insert-property-drawer' and
add a property drawer right below the current headline.  Completion
over drawer keywords is also possible using <M-TAB>.

   Visibility cycling (*note Visibility cycling::) on the headline will
hide and show the entry, but keep the drawer collapsed to a single
line.  In order to look inside the drawer, you need to move the cursor
to the drawer line and press <TAB> there.  Org mode uses the
`PROPERTIES' drawer for storing properties (*note Properties and
Columns::), and you can also arrange for state change notes (*note
Tracking TODO state changes::) and clock times (*note Clocking work
time::) to be stored in a drawer `LOGBOOK'.  If you want to store a
quick note in the LOGBOOK drawer, in a similar way to state changes, use

`C-c C-z'
     Add a time-stamped note to the LOGBOOK drawer.

   You can select the name of the drawers which should be exported with
`org-export-with-drawers'.  In that case, drawer contents will appear in
export output.  Property drawers are not affected by this variable and
are never exported.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) You can define additional drawers on a per-file basis with a
line like `#+DRAWERS: HIDDEN STATE'

2.9 Blocks
==========

Org mode uses begin...end blocks for various purposes from including
source code examples (*note Literal examples::) to capturing time
logging information (*note Clocking work time::).  These blocks can be
folded and unfolded by pressing TAB in the begin line.  You can also
get all blocks folded at startup by configuring the option
`org-hide-block-startup' or on a per-file basis by using

     #+STARTUP: hideblocks
     #+STARTUP: nohideblocks

2.10 Footnotes
==============

Org mode supports the creation of footnotes.  In contrast to the
`footnote.el' package, Org mode's footnotes are designed for work on a
larger document, not only for one-off documents like emails.

   A footnote is started by a footnote marker in square brackets in
column 0, no indentation allowed.  It ends at the next footnote
definition, headline, or after two consecutive empty lines.  The
footnote reference is simply the marker in square brackets, inside
text.  For example:

     The Org homepage[fn:1] now looks a lot better than it used to.
     ...
     [fn:1] The link is: http://orgmode.org

   Org mode extends the number-based syntax to _named_ footnotes and
optional inline definition.  Using plain numbers as markers (as
`footnote.el' does) is supported for backward compatibility, but not
encouraged because of possible conflicts with LaTeX snippets (*note
Embedded LaTeX::).  Here are the valid references:

`[1]'
     A plain numeric footnote marker.  Compatible with `footnote.el',
     but not recommended because something like `[1]' could easily be
     part of a code snippet.

`[fn:name]'
     A named footnote reference, where `name' is a unique label word,
     or, for simplicity of automatic creation, a number.

`[fn:: This is the inline definition of this footnote]'
     A LaTeX-like anonymous footnote where the definition is given
     directly at the reference point.

`[fn:name: a definition]'
     An inline definition of a footnote, which also specifies a name
     for the note.  Since Org allows multiple references to the same
     note, you can then use `[fn:name]' to create additional references.

   Footnote labels can be created automatically, or you can create
names yourself.  This is handled by the variable
`org-footnote-auto-label' and its corresponding `#+STARTUP' keywords.
See the docstring of that variable for details.

The following command handles footnotes:

`C-c C-x f'
     The footnote action command.

     When the cursor is on a footnote reference, jump to the
     definition.  When it is at a definition, jump to the (first)
     reference.

     Otherwise, create a new footnote.  Depending on the option
     `org-footnote-define-inline'(1), the definition will be placed
     right into the text as part of the reference, or separately into
     the location determined by the option `org-footnote-section'.

     When this command is called with a prefix argument, a menu of
     additional options is offered:
          s   Sort the footnote definitions by reference sequence.  During editing,
              Org makes no effort to sort footnote definitions into a particular
              sequence.  If you want them sorted, use this command, which will
              also move entries according to `org-footnote-section'.  Automatic
              sorting after each insertion/deletion can be configured using the
              option `org-footnote-auto-adjust'.
          r   Renumber the simple `fn:N' footnotes.  Automatic renumbering
              after each insertion/deletion can be configured using the option
              `org-footnote-auto-adjust'.
          S   Short for first `r', then `s' action.
          n   Normalize the footnotes by collecting all definitions (including
              inline definitions) into a special section, and then numbering them
              in sequence.  The references will then also be numbers.  This is
              meant to be the final step before finishing a document (e.g., sending
              off an email).
          d   Delete the footnote at point, and all definitions of and references
              to it.
     Depending on the variable `org-footnote-auto-adjust'(2),
     renumbering and sorting footnotes can be automatic after each
     insertion or deletion.

`C-c C-c'
     If the cursor is on a footnote reference, jump to the definition.
     If it is a the definition, jump back to the reference.  When
     called at a footnote location with a prefix argument, offer the
     same menu as `C-c C-x f'.  

`C-c C-o  or mouse-1/2'
     Footnote labels are also links to the corresponding
     definition/reference, and you can use the usual commands to follow
     these links.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The corresponding in-buffer setting is: `#+STARTUP: fninline' or
`#+STARTUP: nofninline'

   (2) the corresponding in-buffer options are `fnadjust' and
`nofnadjust'.

2.11 The Orgstruct minor mode
=============================

If you like the intuitive way the Org mode structure editing and list
formatting works, you might want to use these commands in other modes
like Text mode or Mail mode as well.  The minor mode `orgstruct-mode'
makes this possible.   Toggle the mode with `M-x orgstruct-mode RET', or
turn it on by default, for example in Message mode, with one of:

     (add-hook 'message-mode-hook 'turn-on-orgstruct)
     (add-hook 'message-mode-hook 'turn-on-orgstruct++)

   When this mode is active and the cursor is on a line that looks to
Org like a headline or the first line of a list item, most structure
editing commands will work, even if the same keys normally have
different functionality in the major mode you are using.  If the cursor
is not in one of those special lines, Orgstruct mode lurks silently in
the shadows.

   When you use `orgstruct++-mode', Org will also export indentation and
autofill settings into that mode, and detect item context after the
first line of an item.

   You can also use Org structure editing to fold and unfold headlines
in _any_ file, provided you defined `orgstruct-heading-prefix-regexp':
the regular expression must match the local prefix to use before Org's
headlines.  For example, if you set this variable to `";; "' in Emacs
Lisp files, you will be able to fold and unfold headlines in Emacs Lisp
commented lines.  Some commands like `org-demote' are disabled when the
prefix is set, but folding/unfolding will work correctly.

2.12 Org syntax
===============

A reference document providing a formal description of Org's syntax is
available as a draft on Worg
(http://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html), written and maintained
by Nicolas Goaziou.  It defines Org's core internal concepts such as
`headlines', `sections', `affiliated keywords', `(greater) elements'
and `objects'.  Each part of an Org file falls into one of the
categories above.

   To explore the abstract structure of an Org buffer, run this in a
buffer:

     M-: (org-element-parse-buffer) RET

   It will output a list containing the buffer's content represented as
an abstract structure.  The export engine relies on the information
stored in this list.  Most interactive commands (e.g., for structure
editing) also rely on the syntactic meaning of the surrounding context.

3.1 The built-in table editor
=============================

Org makes it easy to format tables in plain ASCII.  Any line with `|' as
the first non-whitespace character is considered part of a table.  `|'
is also the column separator(1).  A table might look like this:

     | Name  | Phone | Age |
     |-------+-------+-----|
     | Peter |  1234 |  17 |
     | Anna  |  4321 |  25 |

   A table is re-aligned automatically each time you press <TAB> or
<RET> or `C-c C-c' inside the table.  <TAB> also moves to the next
field (<RET> to the next row) and creates new table rows at the end of
the table or before horizontal lines.  The indentation of the table is
set by the first line.  Any line starting with `|-' is considered as a
horizontal separator line and will be expanded on the next re-align to
span the whole table width.  So, to create the above table, you would
only type

     |Name|Phone|Age|
     |-

and then press <TAB> to align the table and start filling in fields.
Even faster would be to type `|Name|Phone|Age' followed by `C-c <RET>'.

   When typing text into a field, Org treats <DEL>, <Backspace>, and
all character keys in a special way, so that inserting and deleting
avoids shifting other fields.  Also, when typing _immediately after the
cursor was moved into a new field with `<TAB>', `S-<TAB>' or `<RET>'_,
the field is automatically made blank.  If this behavior is too
unpredictable for you, configure the options `org-enable-table-editor'
and `org-table-auto-blank-field'.

Creation and conversion
.......................

`C-c |     (`org-table-create-or-convert-from-region')'
     Convert the active region to table.  If every line contains at
     least one TAB character, the function assumes that the material is
     tab separated.  If every line contains a comma, comma-separated
     values (CSV) are assumed.  If not, lines are split at whitespace
     into fields.  You can use a prefix argument to force a specific
     separator: `C-u' forces CSV, `C-u C-u' forces TAB, and a numeric
     argument N indicates that at least N consecutive spaces, or
     alternatively a TAB will be the separator.
     If there is no active region, this command creates an empty Org
     table.  But it is easier just to start typing, like
     `|Name|Phone|Age <RET> |- <TAB>'.

Re-aligning and field motion
............................

`C-c C-c     (`org-table-align')'
     Re-align the table and don't move to another field.  

`<TAB>     (`org-table-next-field')'
     Re-align the table, move to the next field.  Creates a new row if
     necessary.  

`S-<TAB>     (`org-table-previous-field')'
     Re-align, move to previous field.  

`<RET>     (`org-table-next-row')'
     Re-align the table and move down to next row.  Creates a new row if
     necessary.  At the beginning or end of a line, <RET> still does
     NEWLINE, so it can be used to split a table.  

`M-a     (`org-table-beginning-of-field')'
     Move to beginning of the current table field, or on to the
     previous field.  

`M-e     (`org-table-end-of-field')'
     Move to end of the current table field, or on to the next field.

Column and row editing
......................

`M-<left>     (`org-table-move-column-left')'
`M-<right>     (`org-table-move-column-right')'
     Move the current column left/right.  

`M-S-<left>     (`org-table-delete-column')'
     Kill the current column.  

`M-S-<right>     (`org-table-insert-column')'
     Insert a new column to the left of the cursor position.  

`M-<up>     (`org-table-move-row-up')'
`M-<down>     (`org-table-move-row-down')'
     Move the current row up/down.  

`M-S-<up>     (`org-table-kill-row')'
     Kill the current row or horizontal line.  

`M-S-<down>     (`org-table-insert-row')'
     Insert a new row above the current row.  With a prefix argument,
     the line is created below the current one.  

`C-c -     (`org-table-insert-hline')'
     Insert a horizontal line below current row.  With a prefix
     argument, the line is created above the current line.  

`C-c <RET>     (`org-table-hline-and-move')'
     Insert a horizontal line below current row, and move the cursor
     into the row below that line.  

`C-c ^     (`org-table-sort-lines')'
     Sort the table lines in the region.  The position of point
     indicates the column to be used for sorting, and the range of
     lines is the range between the nearest horizontal separator lines,
     or the entire table.  If point is before the first column, you
     will be prompted for the sorting column.  If there is an active
     region, the mark specifies the first line and the sorting column,
     while point should be in the last line to be included into the
     sorting.  The command prompts for the sorting type
     (alphabetically, numerically, or by time).  When called with a
     prefix argument, alphabetic sorting will be case-sensitive.

Regions
.......

`C-c C-x M-w     (`org-table-copy-region')'
     Copy a rectangular region from a table to a special clipboard.
     Point and mark determine edge fields of the rectangle.  If there
     is no active region, copy just the current field.  The process
     ignores horizontal separator lines.  

`C-c C-x C-w     (`org-table-cut-region')'
     Copy a rectangular region from a table to a special clipboard, and
     blank all fields in the rectangle.  So this is the "cut" operation.  

`C-c C-x C-y     (`org-table-paste-rectangle')'
     Paste a rectangular region into a table.  The upper left corner
     ends up in the current field.  All involved fields will be
     overwritten.  If the rectangle does not fit into the present table,
     the table is enlarged as needed.  The process ignores horizontal
     separator lines.  

`M-<RET>     (`org-table-wrap-region')'
     Split the current field at the cursor position and move the rest
     to the line below.  If there is an active region, and both point
     and mark are in the same column, the text in the column is wrapped
     to minimum width for the given number of lines.  A numeric prefix
     argument may be used to change the number of desired lines.  If
     there is no region, but you specify a prefix argument, the current
     field is made blank, and the content is appended to the field
     above.

Calculations
............

`C-c +     (`org-table-sum')'
     Sum the numbers in the current column, or in the rectangle defined
     by the active region.  The result is shown in the echo area and can
     be inserted with `C-y'.  

`S-<RET>     (`org-table-copy-down')'
     When current field is empty, copy from first non-empty field
     above.  When not empty, copy current field down to next row and
     move cursor along with it.  Depending on the option
     `org-table-copy-increment', integer field values will be
     incremented during copy.  Integers that are too large will not be
     incremented.  Also, a `0' prefix argument temporarily disables the
     increment.  This key is also used by shift-selection and related
     modes (*note Conflicts::).

Miscellaneous
.............

`C-c `     (`org-table-edit-field')'
     Edit the current field in a separate window.  This is useful for
     fields that are not fully visible (*note Column width and
     alignment::).  When called with a `C-u' prefix, just make the full
     field visible, so that it can be edited in place.  When called
     with two `C-u' prefixes, make the editor window follow the cursor
     through the table and always show the current field.  The follow
     mode exits automatically when the cursor leaves the table, or when
     you repeat this command with `C-u C-u C-c `'.

`M-x org-table-import RET'
     Import a file as a table.  The table should be TAB or whitespace
     separated.  Use, for example, to import a spreadsheet table or data
     from a database, because these programs generally can write
     TAB-separated text files.  This command works by inserting the
     file into the buffer and then converting the region to a table.
     Any prefix argument is passed on to the converter, which uses it
     to determine the separator.  

`C-c |     (`org-table-create-or-convert-from-region')'
     Tables can also be imported by pasting tabular text into the Org
     buffer, selecting the pasted text with `C-x C-x' and then using the
     `C-c |' command (see above under Creation and conversion).

`M-x org-table-export RET'
     Export the table, by default as a TAB-separated file.  Use for data
     exchange with, for example, spreadsheet or database programs.  The
     format used to export the file can be configured in the option
     `org-table-export-default-format'.  You may also use properties
     `TABLE_EXPORT_FILE' and `TABLE_EXPORT_FORMAT' to specify the file
     name and the format for table export in a subtree.  Org supports
     quite general formats for exported tables.  The exporter format is
     the same as the format used by Orgtbl radio tables, see *note
     Translator functions::, for a detailed description.

   If you don't like the automatic table editor because it gets in your
way on lines which you would like to start with `|', you can turn it
off with

     (setq org-enable-table-editor nil)

Then the only table command that still works is `C-c C-c' to do a
manual re-align.

   (1) To insert a vertical bar into a table field, use `\vert' or,
inside a word `abc\vert{}def'.

3.2 Column width and alignment
==============================

The width of columns is automatically determined by the table editor.
And also the alignment of a column is determined automatically from the
fraction of number-like versus non-number fields in the column.

   Sometimes a single field or a few fields need to carry more text,
leading to inconveniently wide columns.  Or maybe you want to make a
table with several columns having a fixed width, regardless of content.
To set(1) the width of a column, one field anywhere in the column may
contain just the string `<N>' where `N' is an integer specifying the
width of the column in characters.  The next re-align will then set the
width of this column to this value.

     |---+------------------------------|               |---+--------|
     |   |                              |               |   | <6>    |
     | 1 | one                          |               | 1 | one    |
     | 2 | two                          |     ----\     | 2 | two    |
     | 3 | This is a long chunk of text |     ----/     | 3 | This=> |
     | 4 | four                         |               | 4 | four   |
     |---+------------------------------|               |---+--------|

Fields that are wider become clipped and end in the string `=>'.  Note
that the full text is still in the buffer but is hidden.  To see the
full text, hold the mouse over the field--a tool-tip window will show
the full content.  To edit such a field, use the command `C-c `' (that
is `C-c' followed by the backquote).  This will open a new window with
the full field.  Edit it and finish with `C-c C-c'.

   When visiting a file containing a table with narrowed columns, the
necessary character hiding has not yet happened, and the table needs to
be aligned before it looks nice.  Setting the option
`org-startup-align-all-tables' will realign all tables in a file upon
visiting, but also slow down startup.  You can also set this option on
a per-file basis with:

     #+STARTUP: align
     #+STARTUP: noalign

   If you would like to overrule the automatic alignment of number-rich
columns to the right and of string-rich column to the left, you can use
`<r>', `<c>'(2) or `<l>' in a similar fashion.  You may also combine
alignment and field width like this: `<r10>'.

   Lines which only contain these formatting cookies will be removed
automatically when exporting the document.

   (2) Centering does not work inside Emacs, but it does have an effect
when exporting to HTML.

3.3 Column groups
=================

When Org exports tables, it does so by default without vertical lines
because that is visually more satisfying in general.  Occasionally
however, vertical lines can be useful to structure a table into groups
of columns, much like horizontal lines can do for groups of rows.  In
order to specify column groups, you can use a special row where the
first field contains only `/'.  The further fields can either contain
`<' to indicate that this column should start a group, `>' to indicate
the end of a column, or `<>' (no space between `<' and `>') to make a
column a group of its own.  Boundaries between column groups will upon
export be marked with vertical lines.  Here is an example:

     | N | N^2 | N^3 | N^4 | sqrt(n) | sqrt[4](N) |
     |---+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
     | / |   < |     |   > |       < |          > |
     | 1 |   1 |   1 |   1 |       1 |          1 |
     | 2 |   4 |   8 |  16 |  1.4142 |     1.1892 |
     | 3 |   9 |  27 |  81 |  1.7321 |     1.3161 |
     |---+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
     #+TBLFM: $2=$1^2::$3=$1^3::$4=$1^4::$5=sqrt($1)::$6=sqrt(sqrt(($1)))

   It is also sufficient to just insert the column group starters after
every vertical line you would like to have:

     |  N | N^2 | N^3 | N^4 | sqrt(n) | sqrt[4](N) |
     |----+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
     | /  | <   |     |     | <       |            |

3.4 The Orgtbl minor mode
=========================

If you like the intuitive way the Org table editor works, you might
also want to use it in other modes like Text mode or Mail mode.  The
minor mode Orgtbl mode makes this possible.  You can always toggle the
mode with `M-x orgtbl-mode RET'.  To turn it on by default, for example
in Message mode, use

     (add-hook 'message-mode-hook 'turn-on-orgtbl)

   Furthermore, with some special setup, it is possible to maintain
tables in arbitrary syntax with Orgtbl mode.  For example, it is
possible to construct LaTeX tables with the underlying ease and power of
Orgtbl mode, including spreadsheet capabilities.  For details, see
*note Tables in arbitrary syntax::.

3.5 The spreadsheet
===================

The table editor makes use of the Emacs `calc' package to implement
spreadsheet-like capabilities.  It can also evaluate Emacs Lisp forms to
derive fields from other fields.  While fully featured, Org's
implementation is not identical to other spreadsheets.  For example,
Org knows the concept of a _column formula_ that will be applied to all
non-header fields in a column without having to copy the formula to
each relevant field.  There is also a formula debugger, and a formula
editor with features for highlighting fields in the table corresponding
to the references at the point in the formula, moving these references
by arrow keys

3.5.1 References
----------------

To compute fields in the table from other fields, formulas must
reference other fields or ranges.  In Org, fields can be referenced by
name, by absolute coordinates, and by relative coordinates.  To find
out what the coordinates of a field are, press `C-c ?' in that field,
or press `C-c }' to toggle the display of a grid.

Field references
................

Formulas can reference the value of another field in two ways.  Like in
any other spreadsheet, you may reference fields with a letter/number
combination like `B3', meaning the 2nd field in the 3rd row.  However,
Org prefers(1) to use another, more general representation that looks
like this:
     @ROW$COLUMN

   Column specifications can be absolute like `$1', `$2',...`$N', or
relative to the current column (i.e., the column of the field which is
being computed) like `$+1' or `$-2'.  `$<' and `$>' are immutable
references to the first and last column, respectively, and you can use
`$>>>' to indicate the third column from the right.

   The row specification only counts data lines and ignores horizontal
separator lines (hlines).  Like with columns, you can use absolute row
numbers `@1', `@2',...`@N', and row numbers relative to the current row
like `@+3' or `@-1'.  `@<' and `@>' are immutable references the first
and last(2) row in the table, respectively.  You may also specify the
row relative to one of the hlines: `@I' refers to the first hline,
`@II' to the second, etc.  `@-I' refers to the first such line above
the current line, `@+I' to the first such line below the current line.
You can also write `@III+2' which is the second data line after the
third hline in the table.

   `@0' and `$0' refer to the current row and column, respectively,
i.e., to the row/column for the field being computed.  Also, if you omit
either the column or the row part of the reference, the current
row/column is implied.

   Org's references with _unsigned_ numbers are fixed references in the
sense that if you use the same reference in the formula for two
different fields, the same field will be referenced each time.  Org's
references with _signed_ numbers are floating references because the
same reference operator can reference different fields depending on the
field being calculated by the formula.

   Here are a few examples:

     @2$3      2nd row, 3rd column (same as `C2')
     $5        column 5 in the current row (same as `E&')
     @2        current column, row 2
     @-1$-3    the field one row up, three columns to the left
     @-I$2     field just under hline above current row, column 2
     @>$5      field in the last row, in column 5

Range references
................

You may reference a rectangular range of fields by specifying two field
references connected by two dots `..'.  If both fields are in the
current row, you may simply use `$2..$7', but if at least one field is
in a different row, you need to use the general `@row$column' format at
least for the first field (i.e the reference must start with `@' in
order to be interpreted correctly).  Examples:

     $1..$3        first three fields in the current row
     $P..$Q        range, using column names (see under Advanced)
     $<<<..$>>     start in third column, continue to the one but last
     @2$1..@4$3    6 fields between these two fields (same as `A2..C4')
     @-1$-2..@-1   3 fields in the row above, starting from 2 columns on the left
     @I..II        between first and second hline, short for `@I..@II'

Range references return a vector of values that can be fed into Calc
vector functions.  Empty fields in ranges are normally suppressed, so
that the vector contains only the non-empty fields.  For other options
with the mode switches `E', `N' and examples *note Formula syntax for
Calc::.

Field coordinates in formulas
.............................

For Calc formulas and Lisp formulas `@#' and `$#' can be used to get
the row or column number of the field where the formula result goes.
The traditional Lisp formula equivalents are `org-table-current-dline'
and `org-table-current-column'.  Examples:

     if(@# % 2, $#, string(""))   column number on odd lines only
     $3 = remote(FOO, @@#$2)      copy column 2 from table FOO into
                                  column 3 of the current table

For the second example, table FOO must have at least as many rows as
the current table.  Note that this is inefficient(3) for large number
of rows.

Named references
................

`$name' is interpreted as the name of a column, parameter or constant.
Constants are defined globally through the option
`org-table-formula-constants', and locally (for the file) through a
line like

     #+CONSTANTS: c=299792458. pi=3.14 eps=2.4e-6

Also properties (*note Properties and Columns::) can be used as
constants in table formulas: for a property `:Xyz:' use the name
`$PROP_Xyz', and the property will be searched in the current outline
entry and in the hierarchy above it.  If you have the `constants.el'
package, it will also be used to resolve constants, including natural
constants like `$h' for Planck's constant, and units like `$km' for
kilometers(4).  Column names and parameters can be specified in special
table lines.  These are described below, see *note Advanced features::.
All names must start with a letter, and further consist of letters and
numbers.

Remote references
.................

You may also reference constants, fields and ranges from a different
table, either in the current file or even in a different file.  The
syntax is

     remote(NAME-OR-ID,REF)

where NAME can be the name of a table in the current file as set by a
`#+NAME: Name' line before the table.  It can also be the ID of an
entry, even in a different file, and the reference then refers to the
first table in that entry.  REF is an absolute field or range reference
as described above for example `@3$3' or `$somename', valid in the
referenced table.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Org will understand references typed by the user as `B4', but it
will not use this syntax when offering a formula for editing.  You can
customize this behavior using the option
`org-table-use-standard-references'.

   (2) For backward compatibility you can also use special names like
`$LR5' and `$LR12' to refer in a stable way to the 5th and 12th field
in the last row of the table.  However, this syntax is deprecated, it
should not be used for new documents.  Use `@>$' instead.

   (3) The computation time scales as O(N^2) because table FOO is
parsed for each field to be copied.

   (4) `constants.el' can supply the values of constants in two
different unit systems, `SI' and `cgs'.  Which one is used depends on
the value of the variable `constants-unit-system'.  You can use the
`#+STARTUP' options `constSI' and `constcgs' to set this value for the
current buffer.

3.5.2 Formula syntax for Calc
-----------------------------

A formula can be any algebraic expression understood by the Emacs `Calc'
package.  Note that `calc' has the non-standard convention that `/' has
lower precedence than `*', so that `a/b*c' is interpreted as `a/(b*c)'.
Before evaluation by `calc-eval' (*note calc-eval: (calc)Calling Calc
from Your Programs.), variable substitution takes place according to the
rules described above.  The range vectors can be directly fed into the
Calc vector functions like `vmean' and `vsum'.

   A formula can contain an optional mode string after a semicolon.
This string consists of flags to influence Calc and other modes during
execution.  By default, Org uses the standard Calc modes (precision 12,
angular units degrees, fraction and symbolic modes off).  The display
format, however, has been changed to `(float 8)' to keep tables
compact.  The default settings can be configured using the option
`org-calc-default-modes'.

List of modes:

`p20'
     Set the internal Calc calculation precision to 20 digits.

`n3', `s3', `e2', `f4'
     Normal, scientific, engineering or fixed format of the result of
     Calc passed back to Org.  Calc formatting is unlimited in
     precision as long as the Calc calculation precision is greater.

`D', `R'
     Degree and radian angle modes of Calc.

`F', `S'
     Fraction and symbolic modes of Calc.

`T', `t'
     Duration computations in Calc or Lisp, *note Durations and time
     values::.

`E'
     If and how to consider empty fields.  Without `E' empty fields in
     range references are suppressed so that the Calc vector or Lisp
     list contains only the non-empty fields.  With `E' the empty
     fields are kept.  For empty fields in ranges or empty field
     references the value `nan' (not a number) is used in Calc formulas
     and the empty string is used for Lisp formulas.  Add `N' to use 0
     instead for both formula types.  For the value of a field the mode
     `N' has higher precedence than `E'.

`N'
     Interpret all fields as numbers, use 0 for non-numbers.  See the
     next section to see how this is essential for computations with
     Lisp formulas.  In Calc formulas it is used only occasionally
     because there number strings are already interpreted as numbers
     without `N'.

`L'
     Literal, for Lisp formulas only.  See the next section.

Unless you use large integer numbers or high-precision-calculation and
-display for floating point numbers you may alternatively provide a
`printf' format specifier to reformat the Calc result after it has been
passed back to Org instead of letting Calc already do the
formatting(1).  A few examples:

     $1+$2                Sum of first and second field
     $1+$2;%.2f           Same, format result to two decimals
     exp($2)+exp($1)      Math functions can be used
     $0;%.1f              Reformat current cell to 1 decimal
     ($3-32)*5/9          Degrees F -> C conversion
     $c/$1/$cm            Hz -> cm conversion, using `constants.el'
     tan($1);Dp3s1        Compute in degrees, precision 3, display SCI 1
     sin($1);Dp3%.1e      Same, but use printf specifier for display
     taylor($3,x=7,2)     Taylor series of $3, at x=7, second degree

   Calc also contains a complete set of logical operations, (*note
Logical Operations: (calc)Logical Operations.).  For example

`if($1 < 20, teen, string(""))'
     "teen" if age $1 is less than 20, else the Org table result field
     is set to empty with the empty string.

`if("$1" == "nan" || "$2" == "nan", string(""), $1 + $2); E'
     Sum of the first two columns.  When at least one of the input
     fields is empty the Org table result field is set to empty.

`if(typeof(vmean($1..$7)) == 12, string(""), vmean($1..$7); E'
     Mean value of a range unless there is any empty field.  Every
     field in the range that is empty is replaced by `nan' which lets
     `vmean' result in `nan'.  Then `typeof == 12' detects the `nan'
     from `vmean' and the Org table result field is set to empty.  Use
     this when the sample set is expected to never have missing values.

`if("$1..$7" == "[]", string(""), vmean($1..$7))'
     Mean value of a range with empty fields skipped.  Every field in
     the range that is empty is skipped.  When all fields in the range
     are empty the mean value is not defined and the Org table result
     field is set to empty.  Use this when the sample set can have a
     variable size.

`vmean($1..$7); EN'
     To complete the example before: Mean value of a range with empty
     fields counting as samples with value 0.  Use this only when
     incomplete sample sets should be padded with 0 to the full size.

   You can add your own Calc functions defined in Emacs Lisp with
`defmath' and use them in formula syntax for Calc.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The `printf' reformatting is limited in precision because the
value passed to it is converted into an `integer' or `double'.  The
`integer' is limited in size by truncating the signed value to 32 bits.
The `double' is limited in precision to 64 bits overall which leaves
approximately 16 significant decimal digits.

3.5.3 Emacs Lisp forms as formulas
----------------------------------

It is also possible to write a formula in Emacs Lisp.  This can be
useful for string manipulation and control structures, if Calc's
functionality is not enough.

   If a formula starts with a single-quote followed by an opening
parenthesis, then it is evaluated as a Lisp form.  The evaluation
should return either a string or a number.  Just as with `calc'
formulas, you can specify modes and a printf format after a semicolon.

   With Emacs Lisp forms, you need to be conscious about the way field
references are interpolated into the form.  By default, a reference
will be interpolated as a Lisp string (in double-quotes) containing the
field.  If you provide the `N' mode switch, all referenced elements
will be numbers (non-number fields will be zero) and interpolated as
Lisp numbers, without quotes.  If you provide the `L' flag, all fields
will be interpolated literally, without quotes.  I.e., if you want a
reference to be interpreted as a string by the Lisp form, enclose the
reference operator itself in double-quotes, like `"$3"'.  Ranges are
inserted as space-separated fields, so you can embed them in list or
vector syntax.

   Here are a few examples--note how the `N' mode is used when we do
computations in Lisp:

`'(concat (substring $1 1 2) (substring $1 0 1) (substring $1 2))'
     Swap the first two characters of the content of column 1.

`'(+ $1 $2);N'
     Add columns 1 and 2, equivalent to Calc's `$1+$2'.

`'(apply '+ '($1..$4));N'
     Compute the sum of columns 1 to 4, like Calc's `vsum($1..$4)'.


File: org,  Node: Durations and time values,  Next: Field and range formulas,  Prev: Formula syntax for Lisp,  Up: The spreadsheet

3.5.4 Durations and time values
-------------------------------

If you want to compute time values use the `T' flag, either in Calc
formulas or Elisp formulas:

       |  Task 1 |   Task 2 |    Total |
       |---------+----------+----------|
       |    2:12 |     1:47 | 03:59:00 |
       | 3:02:20 | -2:07:00 |     0.92 |
       #+TBLFM: @2$3=$1+$2;T::@3$3=$1+$2;t

   Input duration values must be of the form `[HH:MM[:SS]', where
seconds are optional.  With the `T' flag, computed durations will be
displayed as `HH:MM:SS' (see the first formula above).  With the `t'
flag, computed durations will be displayed according to the value of
the option `org-table-duration-custom-format', which defaults to
`'hours' and will display the result as a fraction of hours (see the
second formula in the example above).

   Negative duration values can be manipulated as well, and integers
will be considered as seconds in addition and subtraction.


File: org,  Node: Field and range formulas,  Next: Column formulas,  Prev: Durations and time values,  Up: The spreadsheet

3.5.5 Field and range formulas
------------------------------

To assign a formula to a particular field, type it directly into the
field, preceded by `:=', for example `:=vsum(@II..III)'.  When you press
<TAB> or <RET> or `C-c C-c' with the cursor still in the field, the
formula will be stored as the formula for this field, evaluated, and the
current field will be replaced with the result.

   Formulas are stored in a special line starting with `#+TBLFM:'
directly below the table.  If you type the equation in the 4th field of
the 3rd data line in the table, the formula will look like
`@3$4=$1+$2'.  When inserting/deleting/swapping column and rows with
the appropriate commands, absolute references (but not relative ones)
in stored formulas are modified in order to still reference the same
field.  To avoid this from happening, in particular in range
references, anchor ranges at the table borders (using `@<', `@>', `$<',
`$>'), or at hlines using the `@I' notation.  Automatic adaptation of
field references does of course not happen if you edit the table
structure with normal editing commands--then you must fix the equations
yourself.

   Instead of typing an equation into the field, you may also use the
following command

`C-u C-c =     (`org-table-eval-formula')'
     Install a new formula for the current field.  The command prompts
     for a formula with default taken from the `#+TBLFM:' line, applies
     it to the current field, and stores it.

   The left-hand side of a formula can also be a special expression in
order to assign the formula to a number of different fields.  There is
no keyboard shortcut to enter such range formulas.  To add them, use
the formula editor (*note Editing and debugging formulas::) or edit the
`#+TBLFM:' line directly.

`$2='
     Column formula, valid for the entire column.  This is so common
     that Org treats these formulas in a special way, see *note Column
     formulas::.

`@3='
     Row formula, applies to all fields in the specified row.  `@>='
     means the last row.

`@1$2..@4$3='
     Range formula, applies to all fields in the given rectangular
     range.  This can also be used to assign a formula to some but not
     all fields in a row.

`$name='
     Named field, see *note Advanced features::.


File: org,  Node: Column formulas,  Next: Lookup functions,  Prev: Field and range formulas,  Up: The spreadsheet

3.5.6 Column formulas
---------------------

When you assign a formula to a simple column reference like `$3=', the
same formula will be used in all fields of that column, with the
following very convenient exceptions: (i) If the table contains
horizontal separator hlines with rows above and below, everything
before the first such hline is considered part of the table _header_
and will not be modified by column formulas.  Therefore a header is
mandatory when you use column formulas and want to add hlines to group
rows, like for example to separate a total row at the bottom from the
summand rows above.  (ii) Fields that already get a value from a
field/range formula will be left alone by column formulas.  These
conditions make column formulas very easy to use.

   To assign a formula to a column, type it directly into any field in
the column, preceded by an equal sign, like `=$1+$2'.  When you press
<TAB> or <RET> or `C-c C-c' with the cursor still in the field, the
formula will be stored as the formula for the current column, evaluated
and the current field replaced with the result.  If the field contains
only `=', the previously stored formula for this column is used.  For
each column, Org will only remember the most recently used formula.  In
the `#+TBLFM:' line, column formulas will look like `$4=$1+$2'.  The
left-hand side of a column formula can not be the name of column, it
must be the numeric column reference or `$>'.

   Instead of typing an equation into the field, you may also use the
following command:

`C-c =     (`org-table-eval-formula')'
     Install a new formula for the current column and replace current
     field with the result of the formula.  The command prompts for a
     formula, with default taken from the `#+TBLFM' line, applies it to
     the current field and stores it.  With a numeric prefix
     argument(e.g., `C-5 C-c =') the command will apply it to that many
     consecutive fields in the current column.


File: org,  Node: Lookup functions,  Next: Editing and debugging formulas,  Prev: Column formulas,  Up: The spreadsheet

3.5.7 Lookup functions
----------------------

Org has three predefined Emacs Lisp functions for lookups in tables.
`(org-lookup-first VAL S-LIST R-LIST &optional PREDICATE)'
     Searches for the first element `S' in list `S-LIST' for which
          (PREDICATE VAL S)
     is `t'; returns the value from the corresponding position in list
     `R-LIST'.  The default `PREDICATE' is `equal'.  Note that the
     parameters `VAL' and `S' are passed to `PREDICATE' in the same
     order as the corresponding parameters are in the call to
     `org-lookup-first', where `VAL' precedes `S-LIST'.  If `R-LIST' is
     `nil', the matching element `S' of `S-LIST' is returned.

`(org-lookup-last VAL S-LIST R-LIST &optional PREDICATE)'
     Similar to `org-lookup-first' above, but searches for the last
     element for which `PREDICATE' is `t'.

`(org-lookup-all VAL S-LIST R-LIST &optional PREDICATE)'
     Similar to `org-lookup-first', but searches for all elements for
     which `PREDICATE' is `t', and returns all corresponding values.
     This function can not be used by itself in a formula, because it
     returns a list of values.  However, powerful lookups can be built
     when this function is combined with other Emacs Lisp functions.

   If the ranges used in these functions contain empty fields, the `E'
mode for the formula should usually be specified: otherwise empty
fields will not be included in `S-LIST' and/or `R-LIST' which can, for
example, result in an incorrect mapping from an element of `S-LIST' to
the corresponding element of `R-LIST'.

   These three functions can be used to implement associative arrays,
count matching cells, rank results, group data etc.  For practical
examples see this tutorial on Worg
(http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-lookups.html).


File: org,  Node: Editing and debugging formulas,  Next: Updating the table,  Prev: Lookup functions,  Up: The spreadsheet

3.5.8 Editing and debugging formulas
------------------------------------

You can edit individual formulas in the minibuffer or directly in the
field.  Org can also prepare a special buffer with all active formulas
of a table.  When offering a formula for editing, Org converts
references to the standard format (like `B3' or `D&') if possible.  If
you prefer to only work with the internal format (like `@3$2' or `$4'),
configure the option `org-table-use-standard-references'.

`C-c =  or  C-u C-c =     (`org-table-eval-formula')'
     Edit the formula associated with the current column/field in the
     minibuffer.  See *note Column formulas::, and *note Field and
     range formulas::.  

`C-u C-u C-c =     (`org-table-eval-formula')'
     Re-insert the active formula (either a field formula, or a column
     formula) into the current field, so that you can edit it directly
     in the field.  The advantage over editing in the minibuffer is
     that you can use the command `C-c ?'.  

`C-c ?     (`org-table-field-info')'
     While editing a formula in a table field, highlight the field(s)
     referenced by the reference at the cursor position in the formula.  

`C-c }'
     Toggle the display of row and column numbers for a table, using
     overlays (`org-table-toggle-coordinate-overlays').  These are
     updated each time the table is aligned; you can force it with `C-c
     C-c'.  

`C-c {'
     Toggle the formula debugger on and off
     (`org-table-toggle-formula-debugger').  See below.  

`C-c '     (`org-table-edit-formulas')'
     Edit all formulas for the current table in a special buffer, where
     the formulas will be displayed one per line.  If the current field
     has an active formula, the cursor in the formula editor will mark
     it.  While inside the special buffer, Org will automatically
     highlight any field or range reference at the cursor position.
     You may edit, remove and add formulas, and use the following
     commands:

    `C-c C-c  or  C-x C-s     (`org-table-fedit-finish')'
          Exit the formula editor and store the modified formulas.
          With `C-u' prefix, also apply the new formulas to the entire
          table.  

    `C-c C-q     (`org-table-fedit-abort')'
          Exit the formula editor without installing changes.  

    `C-c C-r     (`org-table-fedit-toggle-ref-type')'
          Toggle all references in the formula editor between standard
          (like `B3') and internal (like `@3$2').  

    `<TAB>     (`org-table-fedit-lisp-indent')'
          Pretty-print or indent Lisp formula at point.  When in a line
          containing a Lisp formula, format the formula according to
          Emacs Lisp rules.  Another <TAB> collapses the formula back
          again.  In the open formula, <TAB> re-indents just like in
          Emacs Lisp mode.  

    `M-<TAB>     (`lisp-complete-symbol')'
          Complete Lisp symbols, just like in Emacs Lisp mode.  

    `S-<up>/<down>/<left>/<right>'
          Shift the reference at point.  For example, if the reference
          is `B3' and you press `S-<right>', it will become `C3'.  This
          also works for relative references and for hline references.  

    `M-S-<up>     (`org-table-fedit-line-up')'
    `M-S-<down>     (`org-table-fedit-line-down')'
          Move the test line for column formulas in the Org buffer up
          and down.  

    `M-<up>     (`org-table-fedit-scroll-down')'
    `M-<down>     (`org-table-fedit-scroll-up')'
          Scroll the window displaying the table.  

    `C-c }'
          Turn the coordinate grid in the table on and off.

   Making a table field blank does not remove the formula associated
with the field, because that is stored in a different line (the
`#+TBLFM' line)--during the next recalculation the field will be filled
again.  To remove a formula from a field, you have to give an empty
reply when prompted for the formula, or to edit the `#+TBLFM' line.

   You may edit the `#+TBLFM' directly and re-apply the changed
equations with `C-c C-c' in that line or with the normal recalculation
commands in the table.

Using multiple #+TBLFM lines
............................

You may apply the formula temporarily.  This is useful when you switch
the formula.  Place multiple `#+TBLFM' lines right after the table, and
then press `C-c C-c' on the formula to apply.  Here is an example:

     | x | y |
     |---+---|
     | 1 |   |
     | 2 |   |
     #+TBLFM: $2=$1*1
     #+TBLFM: $2=$1*2

Pressing `C-c C-c' in the line of `#+TBLFM: $2=$1*2' yields:

     | x | y |
     |---+---|
     | 1 | 2 |
     | 2 | 4 |
     #+TBLFM: $2=$1*1
     #+TBLFM: $2=$1*2

Note: If you recalculate this table (with `C-u C-c *', for example), you
will get the following result of applying only the first `#+TBLFM' line.

     | x | y |
     |---+---|
     | 1 | 1 |
     | 2 | 2 |
     #+TBLFM: $2=$1*1
     #+TBLFM: $2=$1*2

Debugging formulas
..................

When the evaluation of a formula leads to an error, the field content
becomes the string `#ERROR'.  If you would like see what is going on
during variable substitution and calculation in order to find a bug,
turn on formula debugging in the `Tbl' menu and repeat the calculation,
for example by pressing `C-u C-u C-c = <RET>' in a field.  Detailed
information will be displayed.

3.5.9 Updating the table
------------------------

Recalculation of a table is normally not automatic, but needs to be
triggered by a command.  See *note Advanced features::, for a way to
make recalculation at least semi-automatic.

   In order to recalculate a line of a table or the entire table, use
the following commands:

`C-c *     (`org-table-recalculate')'
     Recalculate the current row by first applying the stored column
     formulas from left to right, and all field/range formulas in the
     current row.  

`C-u C-c *'
`C-u C-c C-c'
     Recompute the entire table, line by line.  Any lines before the
     first hline are left alone, assuming that these are part of the
     table header.  

`C-u C-u C-c *  or  C-u C-u C-c C-c     (`org-table-iterate')'
     Iterate the table by recomputing it until no further changes occur.
     This may be necessary if some computed fields use the value of
     other fields that are computed later in the calculation sequence.

`M-x org-table-recalculate-buffer-tables RET'
     Recompute all tables in the current buffer.

`M-x org-table-iterate-buffer-tables RET'
     Iterate all tables in the current buffer, in order to converge
     table-to-table dependencies.


File: org,  Node: Advanced features,  Prev: Updating the table,  Up: The spreadsheet

3.5.10 Advanced features
------------------------

If you want the recalculation of fields to happen automatically, or if
you want to be able to assign names(1) to fields and columns, you need
to reserve the first column of the table for special marking characters.

`C-#     (`org-table-rotate-recalc-marks')'
     Rotate the calculation mark in first column through the states ` ',
     `#', `*', `!', `$'.  When there is an active region, change all
     marks in the region.

   Here is an example of a table that collects exam results of students
and makes use of these features:

     |---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
     |   | Student | Prob 1 | Prob 2 | Prob 3 | Total | Note |
     |---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
     | ! |         |     P1 |     P2 |     P3 |   Tot |      |
     | # | Maximum |     10 |     15 |     25 |    50 | 10.0 |
     | ^ |         |     m1 |     m2 |     m3 |    mt |      |
     |---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
     | # | Peter   |     10 |      8 |     23 |    41 |  8.2 |
     | # | Sam     |      2 |      4 |      3 |     9 |  1.8 |
     |---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
     |   | Average |        |        |        |  25.0 |      |
     | ^ |         |        |        |        |    at |      |
     | $ | max=50  |        |        |        |       |      |
     |---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
     #+TBLFM: $6=vsum($P1..$P3)::$7=10*$Tot/$max;%.1f::$at=vmean(@-II..@-I);%.1f

Important: please note that for these special tables, recalculating the
table with `C-u C-c *' will only affect rows that are marked `#' or
`*', and fields that have a formula assigned to the field itself.  The
column formulas are not applied in rows with empty first field.

   The marking characters have the following meaning:

`!'
     The fields in this line define names for the columns, so that you
     may refer to a column as `$Tot' instead of `$6'.

`^'
     This row defines names for the fields _above_ the row.  With such
     a definition, any formula in the table may use `$m1' to refer to
     the value `10'.  Also, if you assign a formula to a names field, it
     will be stored as `$name=...'.

`_'
     Similar to `^', but defines names for the fields in the row
     _below_.

`$'
     Fields in this row can define _parameters_ for formulas.  For
     example, if a field in a `$' row contains `max=50', then formulas
     in this table can refer to the value 50 using `$max'.  Parameters
     work exactly like constants, only that they can be defined on a
     per-table basis.

`#'
     Fields in this row are automatically recalculated when pressing
     <TAB> or <RET> or `S-<TAB>' in this row.  Also, this row is
     selected for a global recalculation with `C-u C-c *'.  Unmarked
     lines will be left alone by this command.

`*'
     Selects this line for global recalculation with `C-u C-c *', but
     not for automatic recalculation.  Use this when automatic
     recalculation slows down editing too much.

` '
     Unmarked lines are exempt from recalculation with `C-u C-c *'.
     All lines that should be recalculated should be marked with `#' or
     `*'.

`/'
     Do not export this line.  Useful for lines that contain the
     narrowing `<N>' markers or column group markers.

   Finally, just to whet your appetite for what can be done with the
fantastic `calc.el' package, here is a table that computes the Taylor
series of degree `n' at location `x' for a couple of functions.

     |---+-------------+---+-----+--------------------------------------|

3.6 Org-Plot
============

Org-Plot can produce 2D and 3D graphs of information stored in org
tables using `Gnuplot' `http://www.gnuplot.info/' and `gnuplot-mode'
`http://xafs.org/BruceRavel/GnuplotMode'.  To see this in action, ensure
that you have both Gnuplot and Gnuplot mode installed on your system,
then call `org-plot/gnuplot' on the following table.

     #+PLOT: title:"Citas" ind:1 deps:(3) type:2d with:histograms set:"yrange [0:]"
     | Sede      | Max cites | H-index |
     |-----------+-----------+---------|
     | Chile     |    257.72 |   21.39 |
     | Leeds     |    165.77 |   19.68 |
     | Sao Paolo |     71.00 |   11.50 |
     | Stockholm |    134.19 |   14.33 |
     | Morelia   |    257.56 |   17.67 |

   Notice that Org Plot is smart enough to apply the table's headers as
labels.  Further control over the labels, type, content, and appearance
of plots can be exercised through the `#+PLOT:' lines preceding a
table.  See below for a complete list of Org-plot options.  For more
information and examples see the Org-plot tutorial at
`http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-plot.html'.

Plot Options
............

`set'
     Specify any `gnuplot' option to be set when graphing.

`title'
     Specify the title of the plot.

`ind'
     Specify which column of the table to use as the `x' axis.

`deps'
     Specify the columns to graph as a Lisp style list, surrounded by
     parentheses and separated by spaces for example `dep:(3 4)' to
     graph the third and fourth columns (defaults to graphing all other
     columns aside from the `ind' column).

`type'
     Specify whether the plot will be `2d', `3d', or `grid'.

`with'
     Specify a `with' option to be inserted for every col being plotted
     (e.g., `lines', `points', `boxes', `impulses', etc...).  Defaults
     to `lines'.

`file'
     If you want to plot to a file, specify
     `"PATH/TO/DESIRED/OUTPUT-FILE"'.

`labels'
     List of labels to be used for the `deps' (defaults to the column
     headers if they exist).

`line'
     Specify an entire line to be inserted in the Gnuplot script.

`map'
     When plotting `3d' or `grid' types, set this to `t' to graph a
     flat mapping rather than a `3d' slope.

`timefmt'
     Specify format of Org mode timestamps as they will be parsed by
     Gnuplot.  Defaults to `%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S'.

`script'
     If you want total control, you can specify a script file (place
     the file name between double-quotes) which will be used to plot.
     Before plotting, every instance of `$datafile' in the specified
     script will be replaced with the path to the generated data file.
     Note: even if you set this option, you may still want to specify
     the plot type, as that can impact the content of the data file.

File: org,  Node: Link format,  Next: Internal links,  Prev: Hyperlinks,  Up: Hyperlinks

4.1 Link format
===============

Org will recognize plain URL-like links and activate them as clickable
links.  The general link format, however, looks like this:

     [[link][description]]       or alternatively           [[link]]

Once a link in the buffer is complete (all brackets present), Org will
change the display so that `description' is displayed instead of
`[[link][description]]' and `link' is displayed instead of `[[link]]'.
Links will be highlighted in the face `org-link', which by default is
an underlined face.  You can directly edit the visible part of a link.
Note that this can be either the `link' part (if there is no
description) or the `description' part.  To edit also the invisible
`link' part, use `C-c C-l' with the cursor on the link.

   If you place the cursor at the beginning or just behind the end of
the displayed text and press <BACKSPACE>, you will remove the
(invisible) bracket at that location.  This makes the link incomplete
and the internals are again displayed as plain text.  Inserting the
missing bracket hides the link internals again.  To show the internal
structure of all links, use the menu entry `Org->Hyperlinks->Literal
links'.


File: org,  Node: Internal links,  Next: External links,  Prev: Link format,  Up: Hyperlinks

4.2 Internal links
==================

If the link does not look like a URL, it is considered to be internal
in the current file.  The most important case is a link like
`[[#my-custom-id]]' which will link to the entry with the `CUSTOM_ID'
property `my-custom-id'.  You are responsible yourself to make sure
these custom IDs are unique in a file.

   Links such as `[[My Target]]' or `[[My Target][Find my target]]'
lead to a text search in the current file.

   The link can be followed with `C-c C-o' when the cursor is on the
link, or with a mouse click (*note Handling links::).  Links to custom
IDs will point to the corresponding headline.  The preferred match for
a text link is a dedicated target: the same string in double angular
brackets, like `<<My Target>>'.

   If no dedicated target exists, the link will then try to match the
exact name of an element within the buffer.  Naming is done with the
`#+NAME' keyword, which has to be put the line before the element it
refers to, as in the following example

     #+NAME: My Target
     | a  | table      |
     |----+------------|
     | of | four cells |

   If none of the above succeeds, Org will search for a headline that
is exactly the link text but may also include a TODO keyword and
tags(1).

   During export, internal links will be used to mark objects and
assign them a number.  Marked objects will then be referenced by links
pointing to them.  In particular, links without a description will
appear as the number assigned to the marked object(2).  In the
following excerpt from an Org buffer

     - one item
     - <<target>>another item
     Here we refer to item [[target]].

The last sentence will appear as `Here we refer to item 2' when
exported.

   In non-Org files, the search will look for the words in the link
text.  In the above example the search would be for `my target'.

   Following a link pushes a mark onto Org's own mark ring.  You can
return to the previous position with `C-c &'.  Using this command
several times in direct succession goes back to positions recorded
earlier.

* Menu:

* Radio targets::               Make targets trigger links in plain text

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) To insert a link targeting a headline, in-buffer completion can
be used.  Just type a star followed by a few optional letters into the
buffer and press `M-<TAB>'.  All headlines in the current buffer will
be offered as completions.

   (2) When targeting a `#+NAME' keyword, `#+CAPTION' keyword is
mandatory in order to get proper numbering (*note Images and tables::).


File: org,  Node: Radio targets,  Prev: Internal links,  Up: Internal links

4.2.1 Radio targets
-------------------

Org can automatically turn any occurrences of certain target names in
normal text into a link.  So without explicitly creating a link, the
text connects to the target radioing its position.  Radio targets are
enclosed by triple angular brackets.  For example, a target `<<<My
Target>>>' causes each occurrence of `my target' in normal text to
become activated as a link.  The Org file is scanned automatically for
radio targets only when the file is first loaded into Emacs.  To update
the target list during editing, press `C-c C-c' with the cursor on or
at a target.

4.3 External links
==================

Org supports links to files, websites, Usenet and email messages, BBDB
database entries and links to both IRC conversations and their logs.
External links are URL-like locators.  They start with a short
identifying string followed by a colon.  There can be no space after
the colon.  The following list shows examples for each link type.

     elisp:(find-file-other-frame "Elisp.org") Elisp form to evaluate

   On top of these built-in link types, some are available through the
`contrib/' directory (*note Installation::).  For example, these links
to VM or Wanderlust messages are available when you load the
corresponding libraries from the `contrib/' directory:

     vm:folder                                 VM folder link
     vm:folder#id                              VM message link
     vm://myself@some.where.org/folder#id      VM on remote machine
     vm-imap:account:folder                    VM IMAP folder link
     vm-imap:account:folder#id                 VM IMAP message link
     wl:folder                                 WANDERLUST folder link
     wl:folder#id                              WANDERLUST message link

   For customizing Org to add new link types *note Adding hyperlink
types::.

   A link should be enclosed in double brackets and may contain a
descriptive text to be displayed instead of the URL (*note Link
format::), for example:

     [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]]

If the description is a file name or URL that points to an image, HTML
export (*note HTML export::) will inline the image as a clickable
button.  If there is no description at all and the link points to an
image, that image will be inlined into the exported HTML file.

   Org also finds external links in the normal text and activates them
as links.  If spaces must be part of the link (for example in
`bbdb:Richard Stallman'), or if you need to remove ambiguities about
the end of the link, enclose them in square brackets.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The actual behavior of the search will depend on the value of
the option `org-link-search-must-match-exact-headline'.  If its value
is `nil', then a fuzzy text search will be done.  If it is t, then only
the exact headline will be matched.  If the value is `'query-to-create',
then an exact headline will be searched; if it is not found, then the
user will be queried to create it.

4.4 Handling links
==================

Org provides methods to create a link in the correct syntax, to insert
it into an Org file, and to follow the link.

`C-c l     (`org-store-link')'
     Store a link to the current location.  This is a _global_ command
     (you must create the key binding yourself) which can be used in
     any buffer to create a link.  The link will be stored for later
     insertion into an Org buffer (see below).  What kind of link will
     be created depends on the current buffer:

     Org mode buffers
     For Org files, if there is a `<<target>>' at the cursor, the link
     points to the target.  Otherwise it points to the current
     headline, which will also be the description(1).

     If the headline has a `CUSTOM_ID' property, a link to this custom
     ID will be stored.  In addition or alternatively (depending on the
     value of `org-id-link-to-org-use-id'), a globally unique `ID'
     property will be created and/or used to construct a link(2). So
     using this command in Org buffers will potentially create two
     links: a human-readable from the custom ID, and one that is
     globally unique and works even if the entry is moved from file to
     file.  Later, when inserting the link, you need to decide which
     one to use.

     Email/News clients: VM, Rmail, Wanderlust, MH-E, Gnus
     Pretty much all Emacs mail clients are supported.  The link will
     point to the current article, or, in some GNUS buffers, to the
     group.  The description is constructed from the author and the
     subject.

     Web browsers: W3 and W3M
     Here the link will be the current URL, with the page title as
     description.

     Contacts: BBDB
     Links created in a BBDB buffer will point to the current entry.

     Chat: IRC
     For IRC links, if you set the option `org-irc-link-to-logs' to `t',
     a `file:/' style link to the relevant point in the logs for the
     current conversation is created.  Otherwise an `irc:/' style link
     to the user/channel/server under the point will be stored.

     Other files
     For any other files, the link will point to the file, with a
     search string (*note Search options::) pointing to the contents of
     the current line.  If there is an active region, the selected
     words will form the basis of the search string.  If the
     automatically created link is not working correctly or accurately
     enough, you can write custom functions to select the search string
     and to do the search for particular file types--see *note Custom
     searches::.  The key binding `C-c l' is only a suggestion--see
     *note Installation::.

     Agenda view
     When the cursor is in an agenda view, the created link points to
     the entry referenced by the current line.

`C-c C-l     (`org-insert-link')'
     Insert a link(3).  This prompts for a link to be inserted into the
     buffer.  You can just type a link, using text for an internal
     link, or one of the link type prefixes mentioned in the examples
     above.  The link will be inserted into the buffer(4), along with a
     descriptive text.  If some text was selected when this command is
     called, the selected text becomes the default description.

     Inserting stored links
     All links stored during the current session are part of the
     history for this prompt, so you can access them with <up> and
     <down> (or `M-p/n').

     Completion support
     Completion with <TAB> will help you to insert valid link prefixes
     like `http:' or `ftp:', including the prefixes defined through
     link abbreviations (*note Link abbreviations::).  If you press
     <RET> after inserting only the PREFIX, Org will offer specific
     completion support for some link types(5)  For example, if you
     type `file <RET>', file name completion (alternative access: `C-u
     C-c C-l', see below) will be offered, and after `bbdb <RET>' you
     can complete contact names.  

`C-u C-c C-l'
     When `C-c C-l' is called with a `C-u' prefix argument, a link to a
     file will be inserted and you may use file name completion to
     select the name of the file.  The path to the file is inserted
     relative to the directory of the current Org file, if the linked
     file is in the current directory or in a sub-directory of it, or
     if the path is written relative to the current directory using
     `../'.  Otherwise an absolute path is used, if possible with `~/'
     for your home directory.  You can force an absolute path with two
     `C-u' prefixes.

`C-c C-l  (with cursor on existing link)'
     When the cursor is on an existing link, `C-c C-l' allows you to
     edit the link and description parts of the link.  

`C-c C-o     (`org-open-at-point')'
     Open link at point.  This will launch a web browser for URLs (using
     `browse-url-at-point'), run VM/MH-E/Wanderlust/Rmail/Gnus/BBDB for
     the corresponding links, and execute the command in a shell link.
     When the cursor is on an internal link, this command runs the
     corresponding search.  When the cursor is on a TAG list in a
     headline, it creates the corresponding TAGS view.  If the cursor
     is on a timestamp, it compiles the agenda for that date.
     Furthermore, it will visit text and remote files in `file:' links
     with Emacs and select a suitable application for local non-text
     files.  Classification of files is based on file extension only.
     See option `org-file-apps'.  If you want to override the default
     application and visit the file with Emacs, use a `C-u' prefix.  If
     you want to avoid opening in Emacs, use a `C-u C-u' prefix.
     If the cursor is on a headline, but not on a link, offer all links
     in the headline and entry text.  If you want to setup the frame
     configuration for following links, customize
     `org-link-frame-setup'.

`<RET>'
     When `org-return-follows-link' is set, `<RET>' will also follow
     the link at point.  

`mouse-2'
`mouse-1'
     On links, `mouse-2' will open the link just as `C-c C-o' would.
     Under Emacs 22 and later, `mouse-1' will also follow a link.  

`mouse-3'
     Like `mouse-2', but force file links to be opened with Emacs, and
     internal links to be displayed in another window(6).  

`C-c C-x C-v     (`org-toggle-inline-images')'
     Toggle the inline display of linked images.  Normally this will
     only inline images that have no description part in the link,
     i.e., images that will also be inlined during export.  When called
     with a prefix argument, also display images that do have a link
     description.  You can ask for inline images to be displayed at
     startup by configuring the variable
     `org-startup-with-inline-images'(7).  

`C-c %     (`org-mark-ring-push')'
     Push the current position onto the mark ring, to be able to return
     easily.  Commands following an internal link do this automatically.  

`C-c &     (`org-mark-ring-goto')'
     Jump back to a recorded position.  A position is recorded by the
     commands following internal links, and by `C-c %'.  Using this
     command several times in direct succession moves through a ring of
     previously recorded positions.  

`C-c C-x C-n     (`org-next-link')'
`C-c C-x C-p     (`org-previous-link')'
     Move forward/backward to the next link in the buffer.  At the
     limit of the buffer, the search fails once, and then wraps around.
     The key bindings for this are really too long; you might want to
     bind this also to `C-n' and `C-p'
          (add-hook 'org-load-hook
            (lambda ()
              (define-key org-mode-map "\C-n" 'org-next-link)
              (define-key org-mode-map "\C-p" 'org-previous-link)))

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If the headline contains a timestamp, it will be removed from
the link and result in a wrong link--you should avoid putting timestamp
in the headline.

   (2) The library `org-id.el' must first be loaded, either through
`org-customize' by enabling `org-id' in `org-modules', or by adding
`(require 'org-id)' in your `.emacs'.

   (3)  Note that you don't have to use this command to insert a link.
Links in Org are plain text, and you can type or paste them straight
into the buffer.  By using this command, the links are automatically
enclosed in double brackets, and you will be asked for the optional
descriptive text.

   (4) After insertion of a stored link, the link will be removed from
the list of stored links.  To keep it in the list later use, use a
triple `C-u' prefix argument to `C-c C-l', or configure the option
`org-keep-stored-link-after-insertion'.

   (5) This works by calling a special function
`org-PREFIX-complete-link'.

   (6) See the option `org-display-internal-link-with-indirect-buffer'

   (7) with corresponding `#+STARTUP' keywords `inlineimages' and
`noinlineimages'

4.5 Using links outside Org
===========================

You can insert and follow links that have Org syntax not only in Org,
but in any Emacs buffer.  For this, you should create two global
commands, like this (please select suitable global keys yourself):

     (global-set-key "\C-c L" 'org-insert-link-global)
     (global-set-key "\C-c o" 'org-open-at-point-global)

4.6 Link abbreviations
======================

Long URLs can be cumbersome to type, and often many similar links are
needed in a document.  For this you can use link abbreviations.  An
abbreviated link looks like this

     [[linkword:tag][description]]

where the tag is optional.  The linkword must be a word, starting with
a letter, followed by letters, numbers, `-', and `_'.  Abbreviations
are resolved according to the information in the variable
`org-link-abbrev-alist' that relates the linkwords to replacement text.
Here is an example:

     (setq org-link-abbrev-alist
       '(("bugzilla"  . "http://10.1.2.9/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=")
         ("url-to-ja" . "http://translate.google.fr/translate?sl=en&tl=ja&u=%h")
         ("google"    . "http://www.google.com/search?q=")
         ("gmap"      . "http://maps.google.com/maps?q=%s")
         ("omap"      . "http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?q=%s&polygon=1")
         ("ads"       . "http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-abs_connect?author=%s&db_key=AST")))

   If the replacement text contains the string `%s', it will be
replaced with the tag.  Using `%h' instead of `%s' will url-encode the
tag (see the example above, where we need to encode the URL parameter.)
Using `%(my-function)' will pass the tag to a custom function, and
replace it by the resulting string.

   If the replacement text don't contain any specifier, it will simply
be appended to the string in order to create the link.

   Instead of a string, you may also specify a function that will be
called with the tag as the only argument to create the link.

   With the above setting, you could link to a specific bug with
`[[bugzilla:129]]', search the web for `OrgMode' with
`[[google:OrgMode]]', show the map location of the Free Software
Foundation `[[gmap:51 Franklin Street, Boston]]' or of Carsten office
`[[omap:Science Park 904, Amsterdam, The Netherlands]]' and find out
what the Org author is doing besides Emacs hacking with
`[[ads:Dominik,C]]'.

   If you need special abbreviations just for a single Org buffer, you
can define them in the file with

     #+LINK: bugzilla  http://10.1.2.9/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=
     #+LINK: google    http://www.google.com/search?q=%s

In-buffer completion (*note Completion::) can be used after `[' to
complete link abbreviations.  You may also define a function
`org-PREFIX-complete-link' that implements special (e.g., completion)
support for inserting such a link with `C-c C-l'.  Such a function
should not accept any arguments, and return the full link with prefix.

4.7 Search options in file links
================================

File links can contain additional information to make Emacs jump to a
particular location in the file when following a link.  This can be a
line number or a search option after a double(1) colon.  For example,
when the command `C-c l' creates a link (*note Handling links::) to a
file, it encodes the words in the current line as a search string that
can be used to find this line back later when following the link with
`C-c C-o'.

   Here is the syntax of the different ways to attach a search to a file
link, together with an explanation:

     [[file:~/code/main.c::255]]
     [[file:~/xx.org::My Target]]
     [[file:~/xx.org::*My Target]]
     [[file:~/xx.org::#my-custom-id]]
     [[file:~/xx.org::/regexp/]]

`255'
     Jump to line 255.

`My Target'
     Search for a link target `<<My Target>>', or do a text search for
     `my target', similar to the search in internal links, see *note
     Internal links::.  In HTML export (*note HTML export::), such a
     file link will become an HTML reference to the corresponding named
     anchor in the linked file.

`*My Target'
     In an Org file, restrict search to headlines.

`#my-custom-id'
     Link to a heading with a `CUSTOM_ID' property

`/regexp/'
     Do a regular expression search for `regexp'.  This uses the Emacs
     command `occur' to list all matches in a separate window.  If the
     target file is in Org mode, `org-occur' is used to create a sparse
     tree with the matches.

   As a degenerate case, a file link with an empty file name can be used
to search the current file.  For example, `[[file:::find me]]' does a
search for `find me' in the current file, just as `[[find me]]' would.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For backward compatibility, line numbers can also follow a
single colon.


File: org,  Node: Custom searches,  Prev: Search options,  Up: Hyperlinks

4.8 Custom Searches
===================

The default mechanism for creating search strings and for doing the
actual search related to a file link may not work correctly in all
cases.  For example, BibTeX database files have many entries like
`year="1993"' which would not result in good search strings, because
the only unique identification for a BibTeX entry is the citation key.

   If you come across such a problem, you can write custom functions to
set the right search string for a particular file type, and to do the
search for the string in the file.  Using `add-hook', these functions
need to be added to the hook variables
`org-create-file-search-functions' and
`org-execute-file-search-functions'.  See the docstring for these
variables for more information.  Org actually uses this mechanism for
BibTeX database files, and you can use the corresponding code as an
implementation example.  See the file `org-bibtex.el'.


File: org,  Node: TODO Items,  Next: Tags,  Prev: Hyperlinks,  Up: Top

5 TODO items
************

Org mode does not maintain TODO lists as separate documents(1).
Instead, TODO items are an integral part of the notes file, because
TODO items usually come up while taking notes!  With Org mode, simply
mark any entry in a tree as being a TODO item.  In this way,
information is not duplicated, and the entire context from which the
TODO item emerged is always present.

   Of course, this technique for managing TODO items scatters them
throughout your notes file.  Org mode compensates for this by providing
methods to give you an overview of all the things that you have to do.

* Menu:

* TODO basics::                 Marking and displaying TODO entries
* TODO extensions::             Workflow and assignments
* Progress logging::            Dates and notes for progress
* Priorities::                  Some things are more important than others
* Breaking down tasks::         Splitting a task into manageable pieces
* Checkboxes::                  Tick-off lists

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Of course, you can make a document that contains only long lists
of TODO items, but this is not required.


File: org,  Node: TODO basics,  Next: TODO extensions,  Prev: TODO Items,  Up: TODO Items

5.1 Basic TODO functionality
============================

Any headline becomes a TODO item when it starts with the word `TODO',
for example:

     *** TODO Write letter to Sam Fortune

The most important commands to work with TODO entries are:

`C-c C-t     (`org-todo')'
     Rotate the TODO state of the current item among

          ,-> (unmarked) -> TODO -> DONE --.
          '--------------------------------'

     If TODO keywords have fast access keys (see *note Fast access to
     TODO states::), you will be prompted for a TODO keyword through
     the fast selection interface; this is the default behavior when
     `org-use-fast-todo-selection' is non-`nil'.

     The same rotation can also be done "remotely" from the timeline
     and agenda buffers with the `t' command key (*note Agenda
     commands::).

`C-u C-c C-t'
     When TODO keywords have no selection keys, select a specific
     keyword using completion; otherwise force cycling through TODO
     states with no prompt.  When `org-use-fast-todo-selection' is set
     to `prefix', use the fast selection interface.

`S-<right>  /  S-<left>'
     Select the following/preceding TODO state, similar to cycling.
     Useful mostly if more than two TODO states are possible (*note
     TODO extensions::).  See also *note Conflicts::, for a discussion
     of the interaction with `shift-selection-mode'.  See also the
     variable `org-treat-S-cursor-todo-selection-as-state-change'.  

`C-c / t     (`org-show-todo-tree')'
     View TODO items in a _sparse tree_ (*note Sparse trees::).  Folds
     the entire buffer, but shows all TODO items (with not-DONE state)
     and the headings hierarchy above them.  With a prefix argument (or
     by using `C-c / T'), search for a specific TODO.  You will be
     prompted for the keyword, and you can also give a list of keywords
     like `KWD1|KWD2|...' to list entries that match any one of these
     keywords.  With a numeric prefix argument N, show the tree for the
     Nth keyword in the option `org-todo-keywords'.  With two prefix
     arguments, find all TODO states, both un-done and done.  

`C-c a t     (`org-todo-list')'
     Show the global TODO list.  Collects the TODO items (with not-DONE
     states) from all agenda files (*note Agenda Views::) into a single
     buffer.  The new buffer will be in `agenda-mode', which provides
     commands to examine and manipulate the TODO entries from the new
     buffer (*note Agenda commands::).  *Note Global TODO list::, for
     more information.  

`S-M-<RET>     (`org-insert-todo-heading')'
     Insert a new TODO entry below the current one.

Changing a TODO state can also trigger tag changes.  See the docstring
of the option `org-todo-state-tags-triggers' for details.


File: org,  Node: TODO extensions,  Next: Progress logging,  Prev: TODO basics,  Up: TODO Items

5.2 Extended use of TODO keywords
=================================

By default, marked TODO entries have one of only two states: TODO and
DONE.  Org mode allows you to classify TODO items in more complex ways
with _TODO keywords_ (stored in `org-todo-keywords').  With special
setup, the TODO keyword system can work differently in different files.

   Note that tags are another way to classify headlines in general and
TODO items in particular (*note Tags::).

* Menu:

* Workflow states::             From TODO to DONE in steps
* TODO types::                  I do this, Fred does the rest
* Multiple sets in one file::   Mixing it all, and still finding your way
* Fast access to TODO states::  Single letter selection of a state
* Per-file keywords::           Different files, different requirements
* Faces for TODO keywords::     Highlighting states
* TODO dependencies::           When one task needs to wait for others


File: org,  Node: Workflow states,  Next: TODO types,  Prev: TODO extensions,  Up: TODO extensions

5.2.1 TODO keywords as workflow states
--------------------------------------

You can use TODO keywords to indicate different _sequential_ states in
the process of working on an item, for example(1):

     (setq org-todo-keywords
       '((sequence "TODO" "FEEDBACK" "VERIFY" "|" "DONE" "DELEGATED")))

   The vertical bar separates the TODO keywords (states that _need
action_) from the DONE states (which need _no further action_).  If you
don't provide the separator bar, the last state is used as the DONE
state.  With this setup, the command `C-c C-t' will cycle an entry from
TODO to FEEDBACK, then to VERIFY, and finally to DONE and DELEGATED.
You may also use a numeric prefix argument to quickly select a specific
state.  For example `C-3 C-c C-t' will change the state immediately to
VERIFY.  Or you can use `S-<left>' to go backward through the sequence.
If you define many keywords, you can use in-buffer completion (*note
Completion::) or even a special one-key selection scheme (*note Fast
access to TODO states::) to insert these words into the buffer.
Changing a TODO state can be logged with a timestamp, see *note
Tracking TODO state changes::, for more information.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Changing this variable only becomes effective after restarting
Org mode in a buffer.


File: org,  Node: TODO types,  Next: Multiple sets in one file,  Prev: Workflow states,  Up: TODO extensions

5.2.2 TODO keywords as types
----------------------------

The second possibility is to use TODO keywords to indicate different
_types_ of action items.  For example, you might want to indicate that
items are for "work" or "home".  Or, when you work with several people
on a single project, you might want to assign action items directly to
persons, by using their names as TODO keywords.  This would be set up
like this:

     (setq org-todo-keywords '((type "Fred" "Sara" "Lucy" "|" "DONE")))

   In this case, different keywords do not indicate a sequence, but
rather different types.  So the normal work flow would be to assign a
task to a person, and later to mark it DONE.  Org mode supports this
style by adapting the workings of the command `C-c C-t'(1).  When used
several times in succession, it will still cycle through all names, in
order to first select the right type for a task.  But when you return
to the item after some time and execute `C-c C-t' again, it will switch
from any name directly to DONE.  Use prefix arguments or completion to
quickly select a specific name.  You can also review the items of a
specific TODO type in a sparse tree by using a numeric prefix to `C-c /
t'.  For example, to see all things Lucy has to do, you would use `C-3
C-c / t'.  To collect Lucy's items from all agenda files into a single
buffer, you would use the numeric prefix argument as well when creating
the global TODO list: `C-3 C-c a t'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This is also true for the `t' command in the timeline and agenda
buffers.


File: org,  Node: Multiple sets in one file,  Next: Fast access to TODO states,  Prev: TODO types,  Up: TODO extensions

5.2.3 Multiple keyword sets in one file
---------------------------------------

Sometimes you may want to use different sets of TODO keywords in
parallel.  For example, you may want to have the basic `TODO'/`DONE',
but also a workflow for bug fixing, and a separate state indicating
that an item has been canceled (so it is not DONE, but also does not
require action).  Your setup would then look like this:

     (setq org-todo-keywords
           '((sequence "TODO" "|" "DONE")
             (sequence "REPORT" "BUG" "KNOWNCAUSE" "|" "FIXED")
             (sequence "|" "CANCELED")))

   The keywords should all be different, this helps Org mode to keep
track of which subsequence should be used for a given entry.  In this
setup, `C-c C-t' only operates within a subsequence, so it switches from
`DONE' to (nothing) to `TODO', and from `FIXED' to (nothing) to
`REPORT'.  Therefore you need a mechanism to initially select the
correct sequence.  Besides the obvious ways like typing a keyword or
using completion, you may also apply the following commands:

`C-u C-u C-c C-t'
`C-S-<right>'
`C-S-<left>'
     These keys jump from one TODO subset to the next.  In the above
     example, `C-u C-u C-c C-t' or `C-S-<right>' would jump from `TODO'
     or `DONE' to `REPORT', and any of the words in the second row to
     `CANCELED'.  Note that the `C-S-' key binding conflict with
     `shift-selection-mode' (*note Conflicts::).  

`S-<right>'
`S-<left>'
     `S-<<left>>' and `S-<<right>>' and walk through _all_ keywords
     from all sets, so for example `S-<<right>>' would switch from
     `DONE' to `REPORT' in the example above.  See also *note
     Conflicts::, for a discussion of the interaction with
     `shift-selection-mode'.

5.2.4 Fast access to TODO states
--------------------------------

If you would like to quickly change an entry to an arbitrary TODO state
instead of cycling through the states, you can set up keys for
single-letter access to the states.  This is done by adding the
selection character after each keyword, in parentheses(1).  For example:

     (setq org-todo-keywords
           '((sequence "TODO(t)" "|" "DONE(d)")
             (sequence "REPORT(r)" "BUG(b)" "KNOWNCAUSE(k)" "|" "FIXED(f)")
             (sequence "|" "CANCELED(c)")))

   If you then press `C-c C-t' followed by the selection key, the entry
will be switched to this state.  `SPC' can be used to remove any TODO
keyword from an entry.(2)

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) All characters are allowed except `@^!', which have a special
meaning here.

   (2) Check also the option `org-fast-tag-selection-include-todo', it
allows you to change the TODO state through the tags interface (*note
Setting tags::), in case you like to mingle the two concepts.  Note
that this means you need to come up with unique keys across both sets
of keywords.


File: org,  Node: Per-file keywords,  Next: Faces for TODO keywords,  Prev: Fast access to TODO states,  Up: TODO extensions

5.2.5 Setting up keywords for individual files
----------------------------------------------

It can be very useful to use different aspects of the TODO mechanism in
different files.  For file-local settings, you need to add special lines
to the file which set the keywords and interpretation for that file
only.  For example, to set one of the two examples discussed above, you
need one of the following lines, starting in column zero anywhere in the
file:

     #+TODO: TODO FEEDBACK VERIFY | DONE CANCELED
   (you may also write `#+SEQ_TODO' to be explicit about the
interpretation, but it means the same as `#+TODO'), or
     #+TYP_TODO: Fred Sara Lucy Mike | DONE

   A setup for using several sets in parallel would be:

     #+TODO: TODO | DONE
     #+TODO: REPORT BUG KNOWNCAUSE | FIXED
     #+TODO: | CANCELED

To make sure you are using the correct keyword, type `#+' into the
buffer and then use `M-<TAB>' completion.

   Remember that the keywords after the vertical bar (or the last
keyword if no bar is there) must always mean that the item is DONE
(although you may use a different word).  After changing one of these
lines, use `C-c C-c' with the cursor still in the line to make the
changes known to Org mode(1).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Org mode parses these lines only when Org mode is activated
after visiting a file.  `C-c C-c' with the cursor in a line starting
with `#+' is simply restarting Org mode for the current buffer.


File: org,  Node: Faces for TODO keywords,  Next: TODO dependencies,  Prev: Per-file keywords,  Up: TODO extensions

5.2.6 Faces for TODO keywords
-----------------------------

Org mode highlights TODO keywords with special faces: `org-todo' for
keywords indicating that an item still has to be acted upon, and
`org-done' for keywords indicating that an item is finished.  If you
are using more than 2 different states, you might want to use special
faces for some of them.  This can be done using the option
`org-todo-keyword-faces'.  For example:

     (setq org-todo-keyword-faces
           '(("TODO" . org-warning) ("STARTED" . "yellow")
             ("CANCELED" . (:foreground "blue" :weight bold))))

   While using a list with face properties as shown for CANCELED
_should_ work, this does not always seem to be the case.  If necessary,
define a special face and use that.  A string is interpreted as a
color.  The option `org-faces-easy-properties' determines if that color
is interpreted as a foreground or a background color.


File: org,  Node: TODO dependencies,  Prev: Faces for TODO keywords,  Up: TODO extensions

5.2.7 TODO dependencies
-----------------------

The structure of Org files (hierarchy and lists) makes it easy to
define TODO dependencies.  Usually, a parent TODO task should not be
marked DONE until all subtasks (defined as children tasks) are marked
as DONE.  And sometimes there is a logical sequence to a number of
(sub)tasks, so that one task cannot be acted upon before all siblings
above it are done.  If you customize the option
`org-enforce-todo-dependencies', Org will block entries from changing
state to DONE while they have children that are not DONE.  Furthermore,
if an entry has a property `ORDERED', each of its children will be
blocked until all earlier siblings are marked DONE.  Here is an example:

     * TODO Blocked until (two) is done
     ** DONE one
     ** TODO two

     * Parent
       :PROPERTIES:
       :ORDERED: t
       :END:
     ** TODO a
     ** TODO b, needs to wait for (a)
     ** TODO c, needs to wait for (a) and (b)

`C-c C-x o     (`org-toggle-ordered-property')'
     Toggle the `ORDERED' property of the current entry.  A property is
     used for this behavior because this should be local to the current
     entry, not inherited like a tag.  However, if you would like to
     track the value of this property with a tag for better visibility,
     customize the option `org-track-ordered-property-with-tag'.  

`C-u C-u C-u C-c C-t'
     Change TODO state, circumventing any state blocking.

   If you set the option `org-agenda-dim-blocked-tasks', TODO entries
that cannot be closed because of such dependencies will be shown in a
dimmed font or even made invisible in agenda views (*note Agenda
Views::).

   You can also block changes of TODO states by looking at checkboxes
(*note Checkboxes::).  If you set the option
`org-enforce-todo-checkbox-dependencies', an entry that has unchecked
checkboxes will be blocked from switching to DONE.

   If you need more complex dependency structures, for example
dependencies between entries in different trees or files, check out the
contributed module `org-depend.el'.

5.3 Progress logging
====================

Org mode can automatically record a timestamp and possibly a note when
you mark a TODO item as DONE, or even each time you change the state of
a TODO item.  This system is highly configurable; settings can be on a
per-keyword basis and can be localized to a file or even a subtree.  For
information on how to clock working time for a task, see *note Clocking
work time::.

* Menu:

* Closing items::               When was this entry marked DONE?
* Tracking TODO state changes::  When did the status change?
* Tracking your habits::        How consistent have you been?


File: org,  Node: Closing items,  Next: Tracking TODO state changes,  Prev: Progress logging,  Up: Progress logging

5.3.1 Closing items
-------------------

The most basic logging is to keep track of _when_ a certain TODO item
was finished.  This is achieved with(1)

     (setq org-log-done 'time)

Then each time you turn an entry from a TODO (not-done) state into any
of the DONE states, a line `CLOSED: [timestamp]' will be inserted just
after the headline.  If you turn the entry back into a TODO item
through further state cycling, that line will be removed again.  If you
turn the entry back to a non-TODO state (by pressing <C-c C-t SPC> for
example), that line will also be removed, unless you set
`org-closed-keep-when-no-todo' to non-`nil'.  If you want to record a
note along with the timestamp, use(2)

     (setq org-log-done 'note)

You will then be prompted for a note, and that note will be stored below
the entry with a `Closing Note' heading.

   In the timeline (*note Timeline::) and in the agenda (*note
Weekly/daily agenda::), you can then use the `l' key to display the
TODO items with a `CLOSED' timestamp on each day, giving you an
overview of what has been done.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The corresponding in-buffer setting is: `#+STARTUP: logdone'

   (2) The corresponding in-buffer setting is: `#+STARTUP: lognotedone'.


File: org,  Node: Tracking TODO state changes,  Next: Tracking your habits,  Prev: Closing items,  Up: Progress logging

5.3.2 Tracking TODO state changes
---------------------------------

When TODO keywords are used as workflow states (*note Workflow
states::), you might want to keep track of when a state change occurred
and maybe take a note about this change.  You can either record just a
timestamp, or a time-stamped note for a change.  These records will be
inserted after the headline as an itemized list, newest first(1).  When
taking a lot of notes, you might want to get the notes out of the way
into a drawer (*note Drawers::).  Customize `org-log-into-drawer' to
get this behavior--the recommended drawer for this is called
`LOGBOOK'(2).  You can also overrule the setting of this variable for a
subtree by setting a `LOG_INTO_DRAWER' property.

   Since it is normally too much to record a note for every state, Org
mode expects configuration on a per-keyword basis for this.  This is
achieved by adding special markers `!' (for a timestamp) or `@' (for a
note with timestamp) in parentheses after each keyword.  For example,
with the setting

     (setq org-todo-keywords
       '((sequence "TODO(t)" "WAIT(w@/!)" "|" "DONE(d!)" "CANCELED(c@)")))

   To record a timestamp without a note for TODO keywords configured
with `@', just type `C-c C-c' to enter a blank note when prompted.

you not only define global TODO keywords and fast access keys, but also
request that a time is recorded when the entry is set to DONE(3), and
that a note is recorded when switching to WAIT or CANCELED.  The
setting for WAIT is even more special: the `!' after the slash means
that in addition to the note taken when entering the state, a timestamp
should be recorded when leaving the WAIT state, if and only if the
target state does not configure logging for entering it.  So it has no
effect when switching from WAIT to DONE, because DONE is configured to
record a timestamp only.  But when switching from WAIT back to TODO,
the `/!' in the WAIT setting now triggers a timestamp even though TODO
has no logging configured.

   You can use the exact same syntax for setting logging preferences
local to a buffer:
     #+TODO: TODO(t) WAIT(w@/!) | DONE(d!) CANCELED(c@)

   In order to define logging settings that are local to a subtree or a
single item, define a LOGGING property in this entry.  Any non-empty
LOGGING property resets all logging settings to `nil'.  You may then
turn on logging for this specific tree using STARTUP keywords like
`lognotedone' or `logrepeat', as well as adding state specific settings
like `TODO(!)'.  For example

     * TODO Log each state with only a time

5.3.3 Tracking your habits
--------------------------

Org has the ability to track the consistency of a special category of
TODOs, called "habits".  A habit has the following properties:

  1. You have enabled the `habits' module by customizing `org-modules'.

  2. The habit is a TODO item, with a TODO keyword representing an open
     state.

  3. The property `STYLE' is set to the value `habit'.

  4. The TODO has a scheduled date, usually with a `.+' style repeat
     interval.  A `++' style may be appropriate for habits with time
     constraints, e.g., must be done on weekends, or a `+' style for an
     unusual habit that can have a backlog, e.g., weekly reports.

  5. The TODO may also have minimum and maximum ranges specified by
     using the syntax `.+2d/3d', which says that you want to do the
     task at least every three days, but at most every two days.

  6. You must also have state logging for the `DONE' state enabled
     (*note Tracking TODO state changes::), in order for historical
     data to be represented in the consistency graph.  If it is not
     enabled it is not an error, but the consistency graphs will be
     largely meaningless.

   To give you an idea of what the above rules look like in action,
here's an actual habit with some history:

     ** TODO Shave
        SCHEDULED: <2009-10-17 Sat .+2d/4d>
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-15 Thu]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-12 Mon]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-10 Sat]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-04 Sun]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-02 Fri]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-09-29 Tue]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-09-25 Fri]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-09-19 Sat]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-09-16 Wed]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-09-12 Sat]
        :PROPERTIES:
        :STYLE:    habit
        :LAST_REPEAT: [2009-10-19 Mon 00:36]
        :END:

   What this habit says is: I want to shave at most every 2 days (given
by the `SCHEDULED' date and repeat interval) and at least every 4 days.
If today is the 15th, then the habit first appears in the agenda on Oct
17, after the minimum of 2 days has elapsed, and will appear overdue on
Oct 19, after four days have elapsed.

   What's really useful about habits is that they are displayed along
with a consistency graph, to show how consistent you've been at getting
that task done in the past.  This graph shows every day that the task
was done over the past three weeks, with colors for each day.  The
colors used are:

`Blue'
     If the task wasn't to be done yet on that day.

`Green'
     If the task could have been done on that day.

`Yellow'
     If the task was going to be overdue the next day.

`Red'
     If the task was overdue on that day.

   In addition to coloring each day, the day is also marked with an
asterisk if the task was actually done that day, and an exclamation
mark to show where the current day falls in the graph.

   There are several configuration variables that can be used to change
the way habits are displayed in the agenda.

`org-habit-graph-column'
     The buffer column at which the consistency graph should be drawn.
     This will overwrite any text in that column, so it is a good idea
     to keep your habits' titles brief and to the point.

`org-habit-preceding-days'
     The amount of history, in days before today, to appear in
     consistency graphs.

`org-habit-following-days'
     The number of days after today that will appear in consistency
     graphs.

`org-habit-show-habits-only-for-today'
     If non-`nil', only show habits in today's agenda view.  This is
     set to true by default.

   Lastly, pressing `K' in the agenda buffer will cause habits to
temporarily be disabled and they won't appear at all.  Press `K' again
to bring them back.  They are also subject to tag filtering, if you
have habits which should only be done in certain contexts, for example.

5.4 Priorities
==============

If you use Org mode extensively, you may end up with enough TODO items
that it starts to make sense to prioritize them.  Prioritizing can be
done by placing a _priority cookie_ into the headline of a TODO item,
like this

     *** TODO [#A] Write letter to Sam Fortune

By default, Org mode supports three priorities: `A', `B', and `C'.  `A'
is the highest priority.  An entry without a cookie is treated just
like priority `B'.  Priorities make a difference only for sorting in
the agenda (*note Weekly/daily agenda::); outside the agenda, they have
no inherent meaning to Org mode.  The cookies can be highlighted with
special faces by customizing `org-priority-faces'.

   Priorities can be attached to any outline node; they do not need to
be TODO items.

`C-c ,'
     Set the priority of the current headline (`org-priority').  The
     command prompts for a priority character `A', `B' or `C'.  When
     you press <SPC> instead, the priority cookie is removed from the
     headline.  The priorities can also be changed "remotely" from the
     timeline and agenda buffer with the `,' command (*note Agenda
     commands::).  

`S-<up>     (`org-priority-up')'
`S-<down>     (`org-priority-down')'
     Increase/decrease priority of current headline(1).  Note that
     these keys are also used to modify timestamps (*note Creating
     timestamps::).  See also *note Conflicts::, for a discussion of
     the interaction with `shift-selection-mode'.

   You can change the range of allowed priorities by setting the options
`org-highest-priority', `org-lowest-priority', and
`org-default-priority'.  For an individual buffer, you may set these
values (highest, lowest, default) like this (please make sure that the
highest priority is earlier in the alphabet than the lowest priority):

     #+PRIORITIES: A C B

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See also the option `org-priority-start-cycle-with-default'.


File: org,  Node: Breaking down tasks,  Next: Checkboxes,  Prev: Priorities,  Up: TODO Items

5.5 Breaking tasks down into subtasks
=====================================

It is often advisable to break down large tasks into smaller, manageable
subtasks.  You can do this by creating an outline tree below a TODO
item, with detailed subtasks on the tree(1).  To keep the overview over
the fraction of subtasks that are already completed, insert either
`[/]' or `[%]' anywhere in the headline.  These cookies will be updated
each time the TODO status of a child changes, or when pressing `C-c
C-c' on the cookie.  For example:

     * Organize Party [33%]
     ** TODO Call people [1/2]
     *** TODO Peter
     *** DONE Sarah
     ** TODO Buy food
     ** DONE Talk to neighbor

   If a heading has both checkboxes and TODO children below it, the
meaning of the statistics cookie become ambiguous.  Set the property
`COOKIE_DATA' to either `checkbox' or `todo' to resolve this issue.

   If you would like to have the statistics cookie count any TODO
entries in the subtree (not just direct children), configure
`org-hierarchical-todo-statistics'.  To do this for a single subtree,
include the word `recursive' into the value of the `COOKIE_DATA'
property.

     * Parent capturing statistics [2/20]
       :PROPERTIES:
       :COOKIE_DATA: todo recursive
       :END:

   If you would like a TODO entry to automatically change to DONE when
all children are done, you can use the following setup:

     (defun org-summary-todo (n-done n-not-done)
       "Switch entry to DONE when all subentries are done, to TODO otherwise."
       (let (org-log-done org-log-states)   ; turn off logging
         (org-todo (if (= n-not-done 0) "DONE" "TODO"))))

     (add-hook 'org-after-todo-statistics-hook 'org-summary-todo)

   Another possibility is the use of checkboxes to identify (a
hierarchy of) a large number of subtasks (*note Checkboxes::).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) To keep subtasks out of the global TODO list, see the
`org-agenda-todo-list-sublevels'.


File: org,  Node: Checkboxes,  Prev: Breaking down tasks,  Up: TODO Items

5.6 Checkboxes
==============

Every item in a plain list(1) (*note Plain lists::) can be made into a
checkbox by starting it with the string `[ ]'.  This feature is similar
to TODO items (*note TODO Items::), but is more lightweight.
Checkboxes are not included in the global TODO list, so they are often
great to split a task into a number of simple steps.  Or you can use
them in a shopping list.  To toggle a checkbox, use `C-c C-c', or use
the mouse (thanks to Piotr Zielinski's `org-mouse.el').

   Here is an example of a checkbox list.

     * TODO Organize party [2/4]
       - [-] call people [1/3]
         - [ ] Peter
         - [X] Sarah
         - [ ] Sam
       - [X] order food
       - [ ] think about what music to play
       - [X] talk to the neighbors

   Checkboxes work hierarchically, so if a checkbox item has children
that are checkboxes, toggling one of the children checkboxes will make
the parent checkbox reflect if none, some, or all of the children are
checked.

   The `[2/4]' and `[1/3]' in the first and second line are cookies
indicating how many checkboxes present in this entry have been checked
off, and the total number of checkboxes present.  This can give you an
idea on how many checkboxes remain, even without opening a folded
entry.  The cookies can be placed into a headline or into (the first
line of) a plain list item.  Each cookie covers checkboxes of direct
children structurally below the headline/item on which the cookie
appears(2).  You have to insert the cookie yourself by typing either
`[/]' or `[%]'.  With `[/]' you get an `n out of m' result, as in the
examples above.  With `[%]' you get information about the percentage of
checkboxes checked (in the above example, this would be `[50%]' and
`[33%]', respectively).  In a headline, a cookie can count either
checkboxes below the heading or TODO states of children, and it will
display whatever was changed last.  Set the property `COOKIE_DATA' to
either `checkbox' or `todo' to resolve this issue.

   If the current outline node has an `ORDERED' property, checkboxes
must be checked off in sequence, and an error will be thrown if you try
to check off a box while there are unchecked boxes above it.

The following commands work with checkboxes:

`C-c C-c     (`org-toggle-checkbox')'
     Toggle checkbox status or (with prefix arg) checkbox presence at
     point.  With a single prefix argument, add an empty checkbox or
     remove the current one(3).  With a double prefix argument, set it
     to `[-]', which is considered to be an intermediate state.  

`C-c C-x C-b     (`org-toggle-checkbox')'
     Toggle checkbox status or (with prefix arg) checkbox presence at
     point.  With double prefix argument, set it to `[-]', which is
     considered to be an intermediate state.
        - If there is an active region, toggle the first checkbox in
          the region and set all remaining boxes to the same status as
          the first.  With a prefix arg, add or remove the checkbox for
          all items in the region.

        - If the cursor is in a headline, toggle checkboxes in the
          region between this headline and the next (so _not_ the
          entire subtree).

        - If there is no active region, just toggle the checkbox at
          point.
     
`M-S-<RET>     (`org-insert-todo-heading')'
     Insert a new item with a checkbox.  This works only if the cursor
     is already in a plain list item (*note Plain lists::).  

`C-c C-x o     (`org-toggle-ordered-property')'
     Toggle the `ORDERED' property of the entry, to toggle if
     checkboxes must be checked off in sequence.  A property is used
     for this behavior because this should be local to the current
     entry, not inherited like a tag.  However, if you would like to
     track the value of this property with a tag for better visibility,
     customize `org-track-ordered-property-with-tag'.  

`C-c #     (`org-update-statistics-cookies')'
     Update the statistics cookie in the current outline entry.  When
     called with a `C-u' prefix, update the entire file.  Checkbox
     statistic cookies are updated automatically if you toggle
     checkboxes with `C-c C-c' and make new ones with `M-S-<RET>'.
     TODO statistics cookies update when changing TODO states.  If you
     delete boxes/entries or add/change them by hand, use this command
     to get things back into sync.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) With the exception of description lists.  But you can allow it
by modifying `org-list-automatic-rules' accordingly.

   (2) Set the option `org-checkbox-hierarchical-statistics' if you
want such cookies to count all checkboxes below the cookie, not just
those belonging to direct children.

   (3) `C-u C-c C-c' on the _first_ item of a list with no checkbox
will add checkboxes to the rest of the list.

6 Tags
******

An excellent way to implement labels and contexts for cross-correlating
information is to assign tags to headlines.  Org mode has extensive
support for tags.

   Every headline can contain a list of tags; they occur at the end of
the headline.  Tags are normal words containing letters, numbers, `_',
and `@'.  Tags must be preceded and followed by a single colon, e.g.,
`:work:'.  Several tags can be specified, as in `:work:urgent:'.  Tags
will by default be in bold face with the same color as the headline.
You may specify special faces for specific tags using the option
`org-tag-faces', in much the same way as you can for TODO keywords
(*note Faces for TODO keywords::).

File: org,  Node: Tag inheritance,  Next: Setting tags,  Prev: Tags,  Up: Tags

6.1 Tag inheritance
===================

Tags make use of the hierarchical structure of outline trees.  If a
heading has a certain tag, all subheadings will inherit the tag as
well.  For example, in the list

     * Meeting with the French group      :work:
     ** Summary by Frank                  :boss:notes:
     *** TODO Prepare slides for him      :action:

the final heading will have the tags `:work:', `:boss:', `:notes:', and
`:action:' even though the final heading is not explicitly marked with
those tags.  You can also set tags that all entries in a file should
inherit just as if these tags were defined in a hypothetical level zero
that surrounds the entire file.  Use a line like this(1):

     #+FILETAGS: :Peter:Boss:Secret:

To limit tag inheritance to specific tags, use
`org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance'.  To turn it off entirely, use
`org-use-tag-inheritance'.

   When a headline matches during a tags search while tag inheritance
is turned on, all the sublevels in the same tree will (for a simple
match form) match as well(2).  The list of matches may then become very
long.  If you only want to see the first tags match in a subtree,
configure `org-tags-match-list-sublevels' (not recommended).

   Tag inheritance is relevant when the agenda search tries to match a
tag, either in the `tags' or `tags-todo' agenda types.  In other agenda
types, `org-use-tag-inheritance' has no effect.  Still, you may want to
have your tags correctly set in the agenda, so that tag filtering works
fine, with inherited tags.  Set `org-agenda-use-tag-inheritance' to
control this: the default value includes all agenda types, but setting
this to `nil' can really speed up agenda generation.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) As with all these in-buffer settings, pressing `C-c C-c'
activates any changes in the line.

   (2) This is only true if the search does not involve more complex
tests including properties (*note Property searches::).

6.2 Setting tags
================

Tags can simply be typed into the buffer at the end of a headline.
After a colon, `M-<TAB>' offers completion on tags.  There is also a
special command for inserting tags:

`C-c C-q     (`org-set-tags-command')'
     Enter new tags for the current headline.  Org mode will either
     offer completion or a special single-key interface for setting
     tags, see below.  After pressing <RET>, the tags will be inserted
     and aligned to `org-tags-column'.  When called with a `C-u'
     prefix, all tags in the current buffer will be aligned to that
     column, just to make things look nice.  TAGS are automatically
     realigned after promotion, demotion, and TODO state changes (*note
     TODO basics::).

`C-c C-c     (`org-set-tags-command')'
     When the cursor is in a headline, this does the same as `C-c C-q'.

   Org supports tag insertion based on a _list of tags_.  By default
this list is constructed dynamically, containing all tags currently
used in the buffer.  You may also globally specify a hard list of tags
with the variable `org-tag-alist'.  Finally you can set the default
tags for a given file with lines like

     #+TAGS: @work @home @tennisclub
     #+TAGS: laptop car pc sailboat

   If you have globally defined your preferred set of tags using the
variable `org-tag-alist', but would like to use a dynamic tag list in a
specific file, add an empty TAGS option line to that file:

     #+TAGS:

   If you have a preferred set of tags that you would like to use in
every file, in addition to those defined on a per-file basis by TAGS
option lines, then you may specify a list of tags with the variable
`org-tag-persistent-alist'.  You may turn this off on a per-file basis
by adding a STARTUP option line to that file:

     #+STARTUP: noptag

   By default Org mode uses the standard minibuffer completion
facilities for entering tags.  However, it also implements another,
quicker, tag selection method called _fast tag selection_.  This allows
you to select and deselect tags with just a single key press.  For this
to work well you should assign unique letters to most of your commonly
used tags.  You can do this globally by configuring the variable
`org-tag-alist' in your `.emacs' file.  For example, you may find the
need to tag many items in different files with `:@home:'.  In this case
you can set something like:

     (setq org-tag-alist '(("@work" . ?w) ("@home" . ?h) ("laptop" . ?l)))

If the tag is only relevant to the file you are working on, then you
can instead set the TAGS option line as:

     #+TAGS: @work(w)  @home(h)  @tennisclub(t)  laptop(l)  pc(p)

The tags interface will show the available tags in a splash window.  If
you want to start a new line after a specific tag, insert `\n' into the
tag list

     #+TAGS: @work(w)  @home(h)  @tennisclub(t) \n laptop(l)  pc(p)

or write them in two lines:

     #+TAGS: @work(w)  @home(h)  @tennisclub(t)
     #+TAGS: laptop(l)  pc(p)

You can also group together tags that are mutually exclusive by using
braces, as in:

     #+TAGS: { @work(w)  @home(h)  @tennisclub(t) }  laptop(l)  pc(p)

you indicate that at most one of `@work', `@home', and `@tennisclub'
should be selected.  Multiple such groups are allowed.

Don't forget to press `C-c C-c' with the cursor in one of these lines
to activate any changes.

To set these mutually exclusive groups in the variable `org-tag-alist',
you must use the dummy tags `:startgroup' and `:endgroup' instead of
the braces.  Similarly, you can use `:newline' to indicate a line
break.  The previous example would be set globally by the following
configuration:

     (setq org-tag-alist '((:startgroup . nil)
                           ("@work" . ?w) ("@home" . ?h)
                           ("@tennisclub" . ?t)
                           (:endgroup . nil)
                           ("laptop" . ?l) ("pc" . ?p)))

   If at least one tag has a selection key then pressing `C-c C-c' will
automatically present you with a special interface, listing inherited
tags, the tags of the current headline, and a list of all valid tags
with corresponding keys(1).  In this interface, you can use the
following keys:

`a-z...'
     Pressing keys assigned to tags will add or remove them from the
     list of tags in the current line.  Selecting a tag in a group of
     mutually exclusive tags will turn off any other tags from that
     group.  

`<TAB>'
     Enter a tag in the minibuffer, even if the tag is not in the
     predefined list.  You will be able to complete on all tags present
     in the buffer.  You can also add several tags: just separate them
     with a comma.

`<SPC>'
     Clear all tags for this line.  

`<RET>'
     Accept the modified set.

`C-g'
     Abort without installing changes.

`q'
     If `q' is not assigned to a tag, it aborts like `C-g'.

`!'
     Turn off groups of mutually exclusive tags.  Use this to (as an
     exception) assign several tags from such a group.

`C-c'
     Toggle auto-exit after the next change (see below).  If you are
     using expert mode, the first `C-c' will display the selection
     window.

This method lets you assign tags to a headline with very few keys.  With
the above setup, you could clear the current tags and set `@home',
`laptop' and `pc' tags with just the following keys: `C-c C-c <SPC> h l
p <RET>'.  Switching from `@home' to `@work' would be done with `C-c
C-c w <RET>' or alternatively with `C-c C-c C-c w'.  Adding the
non-predefined tag `Sarah' could be done with `C-c C-c <TAB> S a r a h
<RET> <RET>'.

   If you find that most of the time you need only a single key press to
modify your list of tags, set `org-fast-tag-selection-single-key'.
Then you no longer have to press <RET> to exit fast tag selection--it
will immediately exit after the first change.  If you then occasionally
need more keys, press `C-c' to turn off auto-exit for the current tag
selection process (in effect: start selection with `C-c C-c C-c'
instead of `C-c C-c').  If you set the variable to the value `expert',
the special window is not even shown for single-key tag selection, it
comes up only when you press an extra `C-c'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Keys will automatically be assigned to tags which have no
configured keys.

6.3 Tag groups
==============

In a set of mutually exclusive tags, the first tag can be defined as a
_group tag_.  When you search for a group tag, it will return matches
for all members in the group.  In an agenda view, filtering by a group
tag will display headlines tagged with at least one of the members of
the group.  This makes tag searches and filters even more flexible.

   You can set group tags by inserting a colon between the group tag
and other tags--beware that all whitespaces are mandatory so that Org
can parse this line correctly:

     #+TAGS: { @read : @read_book @read_ebook }

   In this example, `@read' is a _group tag_ for a set of three tags:
`@read', `@read_book' and `@read_ebook'.

   You can also use the `:grouptags' keyword directly when setting
`org-tag-alist':

     (setq org-tag-alist '((:startgroup . nil)
                           ("@read" . nil)
                           (:grouptags . nil)
                           ("@read_book" . nil)
                           ("@read_ebook" . nil)
                           (:endgroup . nil)))

   You cannot nest group tags or use a group tag as a tag in another
group.

   If you want to ignore group tags temporarily, toggle group tags
support with `org-toggle-tags-groups', bound to `C-c C-x q'.  If you
want to disable tag groups completely, set `org-group-tags' to `nil'.

6.4 Tag searches
================

Once a system of tags has been set up, it can be used to collect related
information into special lists.

`C-c / m  or  C-c \     (`org-match-sparse-tree')'
     Create a sparse tree with all headlines matching a
     tags/property/TODO search.  With a `C-u' prefix argument, ignore
     headlines that are not a TODO line.  *Note Matching tags and
     properties::.  

`C-c a m     (`org-tags-view')'
     Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files.  *Note
     Matching tags and properties::.  

`C-c a M     (`org-tags-view')'
     Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files, but
     check only TODO items and force checking subitems (see the option
     `org-tags-match-list-sublevels').

   These commands all prompt for a match string which allows basic
Boolean logic like `+boss+urgent-project1', to find entries with tags
`boss' and `urgent', but not `project1', or `Kathy|Sally' to find
entries which are tagged, like `Kathy' or `Sally'.  The full syntax of
the search string is rich and allows also matching against TODO
keywords, entry levels and properties.  For a complete description with
many examples, see *note Matching tags and properties::.

7 Properties and columns
************************

A property is a key-value pair associated with an entry.  Properties
can be set so they are associated with a single entry, with every entry
in a tree, or with every entry in an Org mode file.

   There are two main applications for properties in Org mode.  First,
properties are like tags, but with a value.  Imagine maintaining a file
where you document bugs and plan releases for a piece of software.
Instead of using tags like `:release_1:', `:release_2:', you can use a
property, say `:Release:', that in different subtrees has different
values, such as `1.0' or `2.0'.  Second, you can use properties to
implement (very basic) database capabilities in an Org buffer.  Imagine
keeping track of your music CDs, where properties could be things such
as the album, artist, date of release, number of tracks, and so on.

   Properties can be conveniently edited and viewed in column view
(*note Column view::).

File: org,  Node: Property syntax,  Next: Special properties,  Prev: Properties and Columns,  Up: Properties and Columns

7.1 Property syntax
===================

Properties are key-value pairs.  When they are associated with a single
entry or with a tree they need to be inserted into a special drawer
(*note Drawers::) with the name `PROPERTIES'.  Each property is
specified on a single line, with the key (surrounded by colons) first,
and the value after it.  Here is an example:

     * CD collection
     ** Classic
     *** Goldberg Variations
         :PROPERTIES:
         :Title:     Goldberg Variations
         :Composer:  J.S. Bach
         :Artist:    Glen Gould
         :Publisher: Deutsche Grammophon
         :NDisks:    1
         :END:

   Depending on the value of `org-use-property-inheritance', a property
set this way will either be associated with a single entry, or the
sub-tree defined by the entry, see *note Property inheritance::.

   You may define the allowed values for a particular property `:Xyz:'
by setting a property `:Xyz_ALL:'.  This special property is
_inherited_, so if you set it in a level 1 entry, it will apply to the
entire tree.  When allowed values are defined, setting the
corresponding property becomes easier and is less prone to typing
errors.  For the example with the CD collection, we can predefine
publishers and the number of disks in a box like this:

     * CD collection
       :PROPERTIES:
       :NDisks_ALL:  1 2 3 4
       :Publisher_ALL: "Deutsche Grammophon" Philips EMI
       :END:

   If you want to set properties that can be inherited by any entry in a
file, use a line like 
     #+PROPERTY: NDisks_ALL 1 2 3 4

   Contrary to properties set from a special drawer, you have to
refresh the buffer with `C-c C-c' to activate this changes.

   If you want to add to the value of an existing property, append a
`+' to the property name.  The following results in the property `var'
having the value "foo=1 bar=2".  
     #+PROPERTY: var  foo=1
     #+PROPERTY: var+ bar=2

   It is also possible to add to the values of inherited properties.
The following results in the `genres' property having the value "Classic
Baroque" under the `Goldberg Variations' subtree.  
     * CD collection
     ** Classic
         :PROPERTIES:
         :GENRES: Classic
         :END:
     *** Goldberg Variations
         :PROPERTIES:
         :Title:     Goldberg Variations
         :Composer:  J.S. Bach
         :Artist:    Glen Gould
         :Publisher: Deutsche Grammophon
         :NDisks:    1
         :GENRES+:   Baroque
         :END:
   Note that a property can only have one entry per Drawer.

   Property values set with the global variable `org-global-properties'
can be inherited by all entries in all Org files.

The following commands help to work with properties:

`M-<TAB>     (`pcomplete')'
     After an initial colon in a line, complete property keys.  All
     keys used in the current file will be offered as possible
     completions.  

`C-c C-x p     (`org-set-property')'
     Set a property.  This prompts for a property name and a value.  If
     necessary, the property drawer is created as well.

`C-u M-x org-insert-drawer RET'
     Insert a property drawer into the current entry.  The drawer will
     be inserted early in the entry, but after the lines with planning
     information like deadlines.  

`C-c C-c     (`org-property-action')'
     With the cursor in a property drawer, this executes property
     commands.  

`C-c C-c s     (`org-set-property')'
     Set a property in the current entry.  Both the property and the
     value can be inserted using completion.  

`S-<right>     (`org-property-next-allowed-value')'
`S-<left>     (`org-property-previous-allowed-value')'
     Switch property at point to the next/previous allowed value.  

`C-c C-c d     (`org-delete-property')'
     Remove a property from the current entry.  

`C-c C-c D     (`org-delete-property-globally')'
     Globally remove a property, from all entries in the current file.  

`C-c C-c c     (`org-compute-property-at-point')'
     Compute the property at point, using the operator and scope from
     the nearest column format definition.

7.2 Special properties
======================

Special properties provide an alternative access method to Org mode
features, like the TODO state or the priority of an entry, discussed in
the previous chapters.  This interface exists so that you can include
these states in a column view (*note Column view::), or to use them in
queries.  The following property names are special and (except for
`:CATEGORY:') should not be used as keys in the properties drawer:

     ID           A globally unique ID used for synchronization during
                  iCalendar or MobileOrg export.
     TODO         The TODO keyword of the entry.
     TAGS         The tags defined directly in the headline.
     ALLTAGS      All tags, including inherited ones.
     CATEGORY     The category of an entry.
     PRIORITY     The priority of the entry, a string with a single letter.
     DEADLINE     The deadline time string, without the angular brackets.
     SCHEDULED    The scheduling timestamp, without the angular brackets.
     CLOSED       When was this entry closed?
     TIMESTAMP    The first keyword-less timestamp in the entry.
     TIMESTAMP_IA The first inactive timestamp in the entry.
     CLOCKSUM     The sum of CLOCK intervals in the subtree.  `org-clock-sum'
                  must be run first to compute the values in the current buffer.
     CLOCKSUM_T   The sum of CLOCK intervals in the subtree for today.
                  `org-clock-sum-today' must be run first to compute the
                  values in the current buffer.
     BLOCKED      "t" if task is currently blocked by children or siblings
     ITEM         The headline of the entry.
     FILE         The filename the entry is located in.


File: org,  Node: Property searches,  Next: Property inheritance,  Prev: Special properties,  Up: Properties and Columns

7.3 Property searches
=====================

To create sparse trees and special lists with selection based on
properties, the same commands are used as for tag searches (*note Tag
searches::).

`C-c / m  or  C-c \     (`org-match-sparse-tree')'
     Create a sparse tree with all matching entries.  With a `C-u'
     prefix argument, ignore headlines that are not a TODO line.  

`C-c a m     (`org-tags-view')'
     Create a global list of tag/property  matches from all agenda
     files.  *Note Matching tags and properties::.  

`C-c a M     (`org-tags-view')'
     Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files, but
     check only TODO items and force checking of subitems (see the
     option `org-tags-match-list-sublevels').

   The syntax for the search string is described in *note Matching tags
and properties::.

   There is also a special command for creating sparse trees based on a
single property:

`C-c / p'
     Create a sparse tree based on the value of a property.  This first
     prompts for the name of a property, and then for a value.  A
     sparse tree is created with all entries that define this property
     with the given value.  If you enclose the value in curly braces,
     it is interpreted as a regular expression and matched against the
     property values.


File: org,  Node: Property inheritance,  Next: Column view,  Prev: Property searches,  Up: Properties and Columns

7.4 Property Inheritance
========================

The outline structure of Org mode documents lends itself to an
inheritance model of properties: if the parent in a tree has a certain
property, the children can inherit this property.  Org mode does not
turn this on by default, because it can slow down property searches
significantly and is often not needed.  However, if you find inheritance
useful, you can turn it on by setting the variable
`org-use-property-inheritance'.  It may be set to `t' to make all
properties inherited from the parent, to a list of properties that
should be inherited, or to a regular expression that matches inherited
properties.  If a property has the value `nil', this is interpreted as
an explicit undefine of the property, so that inheritance search will
stop at this value and return `nil'.

   Org mode has a few properties for which inheritance is hard-coded, at
least for the special applications for which they are used:

`COLUMNS'
     The `:COLUMNS:' property defines the format of column view (*note
     Column view::).  It is inherited in the sense that the level where
     a `:COLUMNS:' property is defined is used as the starting point
     for a column view table, independently of the location in the
     subtree from where columns view is turned on.

`CATEGORY'
     For agenda view, a category set through a `:CATEGORY:' property
     applies to the entire subtree.

`ARCHIVE'
     For archiving, the `:ARCHIVE:' property may define the archive
     location for the entire subtree (*note Moving subtrees::).

`LOGGING'
     The LOGGING property may define logging settings for an entry or a
     subtree (*note Tracking TODO state changes::).


File: org,  Node: Column view,  Next: Property API,  Prev: Property inheritance,  Up: Properties and Columns

7.5 Column view
===============

A great way to view and edit properties in an outline tree is _column
view_.  In column view, each outline node is turned into a table row.
Columns in this table provide access to properties of the entries.  Org
mode implements columns by overlaying a tabular structure over the
headline of each item.  While the headlines have been turned into a
table row, you can still change the visibility of the outline tree.
For example, you get a compact table by switching to CONTENTS view
(`S-<TAB> S-<TAB>', or simply `c' while column view is active), but you
can still open, read, and edit the entry below each headline.  Or, you
can switch to column view after executing a sparse tree command and in
this way get a table only for the selected items.  Column view also
works in agenda buffers (*note Agenda Views::) where queries have
collected selected items, possibly from a number of files.

7.5.1 Defining columns
----------------------

Setting up a column view first requires defining the columns.  This is
done by defining a column format line.

* Menu:

* Scope of column definitions::  Where defined, where valid?
* Column attributes::           Appearance and content of a column


File: org,  Node: Scope of column definitions,  Next: Column attributes,  Prev: Defining columns,  Up: Defining columns

7.5.1.1 Scope of column definitions
...................................

To define a column format for an entire file, use a line like

     #+COLUMNS: %25ITEM %TAGS %PRIORITY %TODO

   To specify a format that only applies to a specific tree, add a
`:COLUMNS:' property to the top node of that tree, for example:

     ** Top node for columns view
        :PROPERTIES:
        :COLUMNS: %25ITEM %TAGS %PRIORITY %TODO
        :END:

   If a `:COLUMNS:' property is present in an entry, it defines columns
for the entry itself, and for the entire subtree below it.  Since the
column definition is part of the hierarchical structure of the document,
you can define columns on level 1 that are general enough for all
sublevels, and more specific columns further down, when you edit a
deeper part of the tree.


File: org,  Node: Column attributes,  Prev: Scope of column definitions,  Up: Defining columns

7.5.1.2 Column attributes
.........................

A column definition sets the attributes of a column.  The general
definition looks like this:

      %[WIDTH]PROPERTY[(TITLE)][{SUMMARY-TYPE}]

Except for the percent sign and the property name, all items are
optional.  The individual parts have the following meaning:

     WIDTH           An integer specifying the width of the column in characters.
                     If omitted, the width will be determined automatically.
     PROPERTY        The property that should be edited in this column.
                     Special properties representing meta data are allowed here
                     as well (*note Special properties::)
     TITLE           The header text for the column.  If omitted, the property
                     name is used.
     {SUMMARY-TYPE}  The summary type.  If specified, the column values for
                     parent nodes are computed from the children.
                     Supported summary types are:
                     {+}       Sum numbers in this column.
                     {+;%.1f}  Like `+', but format result with `%.1f'.
                     {$}       Currency, short for `+;%.2f'.
                     {:}       Sum times, HH:MM, plain numbers are hours.
                     {X}       Checkbox status, `[X]' if all children are `[X]'.
                     {X/}      Checkbox status, `[n/m]'.
                     {X%}      Checkbox status, `[n%]'.
                     {min}     Smallest number in column.
                     {max}     Largest number.
                     {mean}    Arithmetic mean of numbers.
                     {:min}    Smallest time value in column.
                     {:max}    Largest time value.
                     {:mean}   Arithmetic mean of time values.
                     {@min}    Minimum age (in days/hours/mins/seconds).
                     {@max}    Maximum age (in days/hours/mins/seconds).
                     {@mean}   Arithmetic mean of ages (in days/hours/mins/seconds).
                     {est+}    Add low-high estimates.

Be aware that you can only have one summary type for any property you
include.  Subsequent columns referencing the same property will all
display the same summary information.

   The `est+' summary type requires further explanation.  It is used for
combining estimates, expressed as low-high ranges.  For example, instead
of estimating a particular task will take 5 days, you might estimate it
as 5-6 days if you're fairly confident you know how much work is
required, or 1-10 days if you don't really know what needs to be done.
Both ranges average at 5.5 days, but the first represents a more
predictable delivery.

   When combining a set of such estimates, simply adding the lows and
highs produces an unrealistically wide result.  Instead, `est+' adds the
statistical mean and variance of the sub-tasks, generating a final
estimate from the sum.  For example, suppose you had ten tasks, each of
which was estimated at 0.5 to 2 days of work.  Straight addition
produces an estimate of 5 to 20 days, representing what to expect if
everything goes either extremely well or extremely poorly.  In
contrast, `est+' estimates the full job more realistically, at 10-15
days.

   Here is an example for a complete columns definition, along with
allowed values.

     :COLUMNS:  %25ITEM %9Approved(Approved?){X} %Owner %11Status \(1)
                        %10Time_Estimate{:} %CLOCKSUM %CLOCKSUM_T
     :Owner_ALL:    Tammy Mark Karl Lisa Don
     :Status_ALL:   "In progress" "Not started yet" "Finished" ""
     :Approved_ALL: "[ ]" "[X]"

The first column, `%25ITEM', means the first 25 characters of the item
itself, i.e., of the headline.  You probably always should start the
column definition with the `ITEM' specifier.  The other specifiers
create columns `Owner' with a list of names as allowed values, for
`Status' with four different possible values, and for a checkbox field
`Approved'.  When no width is given after the `%' character, the column
will be exactly as wide as it needs to be in order to fully display all
values.  The `Approved' column does have a modified title (`Approved?',
with a question mark).  Summaries will be created for the
`Time_Estimate' column by adding time duration expressions like HH:MM,
and for the `Approved' column, by providing an `[X]' status if all
children have been checked.  The `CLOCKSUM' and `CLOCKSUM_T' columns
are special, they lists the sums of CLOCK intervals in the subtree,
either for all clocks or just for today.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Please note that the COLUMNS definition must be on a single
line--it is wrapped here only because of formatting constraints.

7.5.2 Using column view
-----------------------

Turning column view on and off
..............................

`C-c C-x C-c     (`org-columns')'
     Turn on column view.  If the cursor is before the first headline
     in the file, column view is turned on for the entire file, using
     the `#+COLUMNS' definition.  If the cursor is somewhere inside the
     outline, this command searches the hierarchy, up from point, for a
     `:COLUMNS:' property that defines a format.  When one is found,
     the column view table is established for the tree starting at the
     entry that contains the `:COLUMNS:' property.  If no such property
     is found, the format is taken from the `#+COLUMNS' line or from
     the variable `org-columns-default-format', and column view is
     established for the current entry and its subtree.  

`r     (`org-columns-redo')'
     Recreate the column view, to include recent changes made in the
     buffer.  

`g     (`org-columns-redo')'
     Same as `r'.  

`q     (`org-columns-quit')'
     Exit column view.

Editing values
..............

`<left> <right> <up> <down>'
     Move through the column view from field to field.  

`S-<left>/<right>'
     Switch to the next/previous allowed value of the field.  For this,
     you have to have specified allowed values for a property.

`1..9,0'
     Directly select the Nth allowed value, `0' selects the 10th value.  

`n     (`org-columns-next-allowed-value')'
`p     (`org-columns-previous-allowed-value')'
     Same as `S-<left>/<right>' 

`e     (`org-columns-edit-value')'
     Edit the property at point.  For the special properties, this will
     invoke the same interface that you normally use to change that
     property.  For example, when editing a TAGS property, the tag
     completion or fast selection interface will pop up.  

`C-c C-c     (`org-columns-set-tags-or-toggle')'
     When there is a checkbox at point, toggle it.  

`v     (`org-columns-show-value')'
     View the full value of this property.  This is useful if the width
     of the column is smaller than that of the value.  

`a     (`org-columns-edit-allowed')'
     Edit the list of allowed values for this property.  If the list is
     found in the hierarchy, the modified values is stored there.  If
     no list is found, the new value is stored in the first entry that
     is part of the current column view.

Modifying the table structure
.............................

`<     (`org-columns-narrow')'
`>     (`org-columns-widen')'
     Make the column narrower/wider by one character.  

`S-M-<right>     (`org-columns-new')'
     Insert a new column, to the left of the current column.  

`S-M-<left>     (`org-columns-delete')'
     Delete the current column.


File: org,  Node: Capturing column view,  Prev: Using column view,  Up: Column view

7.5.3 Capturing column view
---------------------------

Since column view is just an overlay over a buffer, it cannot be
exported or printed directly.  If you want to capture a column view, use
a `columnview' dynamic block (*note Dynamic blocks::).  The frame of
this block looks like this:

     * The column view
     #+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id "label"

     #+END:

This dynamic block has the following parameters:

`:id'
     This is the most important parameter.  Column view is a feature
     that is often localized to a certain (sub)tree, and the capture
     block might be at a different location in the file.  To identify
     the tree whose view to capture, you can use 4 values: 
          local     use the tree in which the capture block is located
          global    make a global view, including all headings in the file
          "file:PATH-TO-FILE"
                    run column view at the top of this file
          "ID"      call column view in the tree that has an `:ID:'
                    property with the value label.  You can use
                    `M-x org-id-copy RET' to create a globally unique ID for
                    the current entry and copy it to the kill-ring.

`:hlines'
     When `t', insert an hline after every line.  When a number N,
     insert an hline before each headline with level `<= N'.

`:vlines'
     When set to `t', force column groups to get vertical lines.

`:maxlevel'
     When set to a number, don't capture entries below this level.

`:skip-empty-rows'
     When set to `t', skip rows where the only non-empty specifier of
     the column view is `ITEM'.


The following commands insert or update the dynamic block:

`C-c C-x i     (`org-insert-columns-dblock')'
     Insert a dynamic block capturing a column view.  You will be
     prompted for the scope or ID of the view.  

`C-c C-c  or  C-c C-x C-u     (`org-dblock-update')'
     Update dynamic block at point.  The cursor needs to be in the
     `#+BEGIN' line of the dynamic block.  

`C-u C-c C-x C-u     (`org-update-all-dblocks')'
     Update all dynamic blocks (*note Dynamic blocks::).  This is
     useful if you have several clock table blocks, column-capturing
     blocks or other dynamic blocks in a buffer.

   You can add formulas to the column view table and you may add
plotting instructions in front of the table--these will survive an
update of the block.  If there is a `#+TBLFM:' after the table, the
table will actually be recalculated automatically after an update.

   An alternative way to capture and process property values into a
table is provided by Eric Schulte's `org-collector.el' which is a
contributed package(1).  It provides a general API to collect
properties from entries in a certain scope, and arbitrary Lisp
expressions to process these values before inserting them into a table
or a dynamic block.

7.6 The Property API
====================

There is a full API for accessing and changing properties.  This API can
be used by Emacs Lisp programs to work with properties and to implement
features based on them.  For more information see *note Using the

8 Dates and times
*****************

To assist project planning, TODO items can be labeled with a date and/or
a time.  The specially formatted string carrying the date and time
information is called a _timestamp_ in Org mode.  This may be a little
confusing because timestamp is often used as indicating when something
was created or last changed.  However, in Org mode this term is used in
a much wider sense.

8.1 Timestamps, deadlines, and scheduling
=========================================

A timestamp is a specification of a date (possibly with a time or a
range of times) in a special format, either `<2003-09-16 Tue>'(1) or
`<2003-09-16 Tue 09:39>' or `<2003-09-16 Tue 12:00-12:30>'(2).  A
timestamp can appear anywhere in the headline or body of an Org tree
entry.  Its presence causes entries to be shown on specific dates in the
agenda (*note Weekly/daily agenda::).  We distinguish:

PLAIN TIMESTAMP; EVENT; APPOINTMENT
     A simple timestamp just assigns a date/time to an item.  This is
     just like writing down an appointment or event in a paper agenda.
     In the timeline and agenda displays, the headline of an entry
     associated with a plain timestamp will be shown exactly on that
     date.

          * Meet Peter at the movies
            <2006-11-01 Wed 19:15>
          * Discussion on climate change
            <2006-11-02 Thu 20:00-22:00>

TIMESTAMP WITH REPEATER INTERVAL
     A timestamp may contain a _repeater interval_, indicating that it
     applies not only on the given date, but again and again after a
     certain interval of N days (d), weeks (w), months (m), or years
     (y).  The following will show up in the agenda every Wednesday:

          * Pick up Sam at school
            <2007-05-16 Wed 12:30 +1w>

DIARY-STYLE SEXP ENTRIES
     For more complex date specifications, Org mode supports using the
     special sexp diary entries implemented in the Emacs calendar/diary
     package(3).  For example with optional time

          * 22:00-23:00 The nerd meeting on every 2nd Thursday of the month
            <%%(diary-float t 4 2)>

TIME/DATE RANGE
     Two timestamps connected by `--' denote a range.  The headline
     will be shown on the first and last day of the range, and on any
     dates that are displayed and fall in the range.  Here is an
     example:

          ** Meeting in Amsterdam
             <2004-08-23 Mon>--<2004-08-26 Thu>

INACTIVE TIMESTAMP
     Just like a plain timestamp, but with square brackets instead of
     angular ones.  These timestamps are inactive in the sense that
     they do _not_ trigger an entry to show up in the agenda.

          * Gillian comes late for the fifth time
            [2006-11-01 Wed]


   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) In this simplest form, the day name is optional when you type
the date yourself.  However, any dates inserted or modified by Org will
add that day name, for reading convenience.

   (2) This is inspired by the standard ISO 8601 date/time format.  To
use an alternative format, see *note Custom time format::.

   (3) When working with the standard diary sexp functions, you need to
be very careful with the order of the arguments.  That order depend
evilly on the variable `calendar-date-style' (or, for older Emacs
versions, `european-calendar-style').  For example, to specify a date
December 12, 2005, the call might look like `(diary-date 12 1 2005)' or
`(diary-date 1 12 2005)' or `(diary-date 2005 12 1)', depending on the
settings.  This has been the source of much confusion.  Org mode users
can resort to special versions of these functions like `org-date' or
`org-anniversary'.  These work just like the corresponding `diary-'
functions, but with stable ISO order of arguments (year, month, day)
wherever applicable, independent of the value of `calendar-date-style'.

8.2 Creating timestamps
=======================

For Org mode to recognize timestamps, they need to be in the specific
format.  All commands listed below produce timestamps in the correct
format.

`C-c .     (`org-time-stamp')'
     Prompt for a date and insert a corresponding timestamp.  When the
     cursor is at an existing timestamp in the buffer, the command is
     used to modify this timestamp instead of inserting a new one.
     When this command is used twice in succession, a time range is
     inserted.  

`C-c !     (`org-time-stamp-inactive')'
     Like `C-c .', but insert an inactive timestamp that will not cause
     an agenda entry.  

`C-u C-c .'
`C-u C-c !'
     Like `C-c .' and `C-c !', but use the alternative format which
     contains date and time.  The default time can be rounded to
     multiples of 5 minutes, see the option
     `org-time-stamp-rounding-minutes'.  

`C-c C-c'
     Normalize timestamp, insert/fix day name if missing or wrong.  

`C-c <     (`org-date-from-calendar')'
     Insert a timestamp corresponding to the cursor date in the
     Calendar.  

`C-c >     (`org-goto-calendar')'
     Access the Emacs calendar for the current date.  If there is a
     timestamp in the current line, go to the corresponding date
     instead.  

`C-c C-o     (`org-open-at-point')'
     Access the agenda for the date given by the timestamp or -range at
     point (*note Weekly/daily agenda::).  

`S-<left>     (`org-timestamp-down-day')'
`S-<right>     (`org-timestamp-up-day')'
     Change date at cursor by one day.  These key bindings conflict with
     shift-selection and related modes (*note Conflicts::).  

`S-<up>     (`org-timestamp-up')'
`S-<down>     (`org-timestamp-down-down')'
     Change the item under the cursor in a timestamp.  The cursor can
     be on a year, month, day, hour or minute.  When the timestamp
     contains a time range like `15:30-16:30', modifying the first time
     will also shift the second, shifting the time block with constant
     length.  To change the length, modify the second time.  Note that
     if the cursor is in a headline and not at a timestamp, these same
     keys modify the priority of an item.  (*note Priorities::).  The
     key bindings also conflict with shift-selection and related modes
     (*note Conflicts::).  

`C-c C-y     (`org-evaluate-time-range')'
     Evaluate a time range by computing the difference between start
     and end.  With a prefix argument, insert result after the time
     range (in a table: into the following column).

File: org,  Node: The date/time prompt,  Next: Custom time format,  Prev: Creating timestamps,  Up: Creating timestamps

8.2.1 The date/time prompt
--------------------------

When Org mode prompts for a date/time, the default is shown in default
date/time format, and the prompt therefore seems to ask for a specific
format.  But it will in fact accept date/time information in a variety
of formats.  Generally, the information should start at the beginning
of the string.  Org mode will find whatever information is in there and
derive anything you have not specified from the _default date and
time_.  The default is usually the current date and time, but when
modifying an existing timestamp, or when entering the second stamp of a
range, it is taken from the stamp in the buffer.  When filling in
information, Org mode assumes that most of the time you will want to
enter a date in the future: if you omit the month/year and the given
day/month is before today, it will assume that you mean a future
date(1).  If the date has been automatically shifted into the future,
the time prompt will show this with `(=>F).'

   For example, let's assume that today is June 13, 2006.  Here is how
various inputs will be interpreted, the items filled in by Org mode are
in bold.

     3-2-5         => 2003-02-05
     2/5/3         => 2003-02-05
     14            => 2006-06-14
     12            => 2006-07-12
     2/5           => 2007-02-05
     Fri           => nearest Friday after the default date
     sep 15        => 2006-09-15
     feb 15        => 2007-02-15
     sep 12 9      => 2009-09-12
     12:45         => 2006-06-13 12:45
     22 sept 0:34  => 2006-09-22 0:34
     w4            => ISO week for of the current year 2006
     2012 w4 fri   => Friday of ISO week 4 in 2012
     2012-w04-5    => Same as above

   Furthermore you can specify a relative date by giving, as the _first_
thing in the input: a plus/minus sign, a number and a letter ([hdwmy])
to indicate change in hours, days, weeks, months, or years.  With a
single plus or minus, the date is always relative to today.  With a
double plus or minus, it is relative to the default date.  If instead
of a single letter, you use the abbreviation of day name, the date will
be the Nth such day, e.g.:

     +0            => today
     .             => today
     +4d           => four days from today
     +4            => same as above
     +2w           => two weeks from today
     ++5           => five days from default date
     +2tue         => second Tuesday from now
     -wed          => last Wednesday

   The function understands English month and weekday abbreviations.  If
you want to use unabbreviated names and/or other languages, configure
the variables `parse-time-months' and `parse-time-weekdays'.

   Not all dates can be represented in a given Emacs implementation.
By default Org mode forces dates into the compatibility range 1970-2037
which works on all Emacs implementations.  If you want to use dates
outside of this range, read the docstring of the variable
`org-read-date-force-compatible-dates'.

   You can specify a time range by giving start and end times or by
giving a start time and a duration (in HH:MM format).  Use one or two
dash(es) as the separator in the former case and use '+' as the
separator in the latter case, e.g.:

     11am-1:15pm    => 11:00-13:15
     11am--1:15pm   => same as above
     11am+2:15      => same as above

   Parallel to the minibuffer prompt, a calendar is popped up(2).  When
you exit the date prompt, either by clicking on a date in the calendar,
or by pressing <RET>, the date selected in the calendar will be
combined with the information entered at the prompt.  You can control
the calendar fully from the minibuffer:

     <RET>           Choose date at cursor in calendar.
     mouse-1        Select date by clicking on it.
     S-<right>/<left>     One day forward/backward.
     S-<down>/<up>     One week forward/backward.
     M-S-<right>/<left>   One month forward/backward.
     > / <          Scroll calendar forward/backward by one month.
     M-v / C-v      Scroll calendar forward/backward by 3 months.

   The actions of the date/time prompt may seem complex, but I assure
you they will grow on you, and you will start getting annoyed by pretty
much any other way of entering a date/time out there.  To help you
understand what is going on, the current interpretation of your input
will be displayed live in the minibuffer(3).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See the variable `org-read-date-prefer-future'.  You may set
that variable to the symbol `time' to even make a time before now shift
the date to tomorrow.

   (2) If you don't need/want the calendar, configure the variable
`org-popup-calendar-for-date-prompt'.

   (3) If you find this distracting, turn the display off with
`org-read-date-display-live'.


File: org,  Node: Custom time format,  Prev: The date/time prompt,  Up: Creating timestamps

8.2.2 Custom time format
------------------------

Org mode uses the standard ISO notation for dates and times as it is
defined in ISO 8601.  If you cannot get used to this and require another
representation of date and time to keep you happy, you can get it by
customizing the options `org-display-custom-times' and
`org-time-stamp-custom-formats'.

`C-c C-x C-t     (`org-toggle-time-stamp-overlays')'
     Toggle the display of custom formats for dates and times.

Org mode needs the default format for scanning, so the custom date/time
format does not _replace_ the default format--instead it is put _over_
the default format using text properties.  This has the following
consequences:
   * You cannot place the cursor onto a timestamp anymore, only before
     or after.

   * The `S-<up>/<down>' keys can no longer be used to adjust each
     component of a timestamp.  If the cursor is at the beginning of
     the stamp, `S-<up>/<down>' will change the stamp by one day, just
     like `S-<left>/<right>'.  At the end of the stamp, the time will
     be changed by one minute.

   * If the timestamp contains a range of clock times or a repeater,
     these will not be overlaid, but remain in the buffer as they were.

   * When you delete a timestamp character-by-character, it will only
     disappear from the buffer after _all_ (invisible) characters
     belonging to the ISO timestamp have been removed.

   * If the custom timestamp format is longer than the default and you
     are using dates in tables, table alignment will be messed up.  If
     the custom format is shorter, things do work as expected.

8.3 Deadlines and scheduling
============================

A timestamp may be preceded by special keywords to facilitate planning:

DEADLINE
     Meaning: the task (most likely a TODO item, though not
     necessarily) is supposed to be finished on that date.

     On the deadline date, the task will be listed in the agenda.  In
     addition, the agenda for _today_ will carry a warning about the
     approaching or missed deadline, starting
     `org-deadline-warning-days' before the due date, and continuing
     until the entry is marked DONE.  An example:

          *** TODO write article about the Earth for the Guide
              DEADLINE: <2004-02-29 Sun>
              The editor in charge is [[bbdb:Ford Prefect]]

     You can specify a different lead time for warnings for a specific
     deadlines using the following syntax.  Here is an example with a
     warning period of 5 days `DEADLINE: <2004-02-29 Sun -5d>'.  This
     warning is deactivated if the task get scheduled and you set
     `org-agenda-skip-deadline-prewarning-if-scheduled' to `t'.

SCHEDULED
     Meaning: you are planning to start working on that task on the
     given date.

     The headline will be listed under the given date(1).  In addition,
     a reminder that the scheduled date has passed will be present in
     the compilation for _today_, until the entry is marked DONE, i.e.,
     the task will automatically be forwarded until completed.

          *** TODO Call Trillian for a date on New Years Eve.
              SCHEDULED: <2004-12-25 Sat>

     If you want to _delay_ the display of this task in the agenda, use
     `SCHEDULED: <2004-12-25 Sat -2d>': the task is still scheduled on
     the 25th but will appear two days later.  In case the task
     contains a repeater, the delay is considered to affect all
     occurrences; if you want the delay to only affect the first
     scheduled occurrence of the task, use `--2d' instead.  See
     `org-scheduled-delay-days' and
     `org-agenda-skip-scheduled-delay-if-deadline' for details on how to
     control this globally or per agenda.

     Important: Scheduling an item in Org mode should not be understood
     in the same way that we understand scheduling a meeting.  Setting
     a date for a meeting is just a simple appointment, you should mark
     this entry with a simple plain timestamp, to get this item shown
     on the date where it applies.  This is a frequent misunderstanding
     by Org users.  In Org mode, scheduling means setting a date when
     you want to start working on an action item.

   You may use timestamps with repeaters in scheduling and deadline
entries.  Org mode will issue early and late warnings based on the
assumption that the timestamp represents the nearest instance of the
repeater.  However, the use of diary sexp entries like `<%%(diary-float
t 42)>' in scheduling and deadline timestamps is limited.  Org mode
does not know enough about the internals of each sexp function to issue
early and late warnings.  However, it will show the item on each day
where the sexp entry matches.

File: org,  Node: Inserting deadline/schedule,  Next: Repeated tasks,  Prev: Deadlines and scheduling,  Up: Deadlines and scheduling

8.3.1 Inserting deadlines or schedules
--------------------------------------

The following commands allow you to quickly insert(1) a deadline or to
schedule an item:

`C-c C-d     (`org-deadline')'
     Insert `DEADLINE' keyword along with a stamp.  The insertion will
     happen in the line directly following the headline.  Any CLOSED
     timestamp will be removed.  When called with a prefix arg, an
     existing deadline will be removed from the entry.  Depending on
     the variable `org-log-redeadline'(2), a note will be taken when
     changing an existing deadline.

`C-c C-s     (`org-schedule')'
     Insert `SCHEDULED' keyword along with a stamp.  The insertion will
     happen in the line directly following the headline.  Any CLOSED
     timestamp will be removed.  When called with a prefix argument,
     remove the scheduling date from the entry.  Depending on the
     variable `org-log-reschedule'(3), a note will be taken when
     changing an existing scheduling time.  

`C-c C-x C-k     (`org-mark-entry-for-agenda-action')'
     Mark the current entry for agenda action.  After you have marked
     the entry like this, you can open the agenda or the calendar to
     find an appropriate date.  With the cursor on the selected date,
     press `k s' or `k d' to schedule the marked item.  

`C-c / d     (`org-check-deadlines')'
     Create a sparse tree with all deadlines that are either past-due,
     or which will become due within `org-deadline-warning-days'.  With
     `C-u' prefix, show all deadlines in the file.  With a numeric
     prefix, check that many days.  For example, `C-1 C-c / d' shows
     all deadlines due tomorrow.  

`C-c / b     (`org-check-before-date')'
     Sparse tree for deadlines and scheduled items before a given date.  

`C-c / a     (`org-check-after-date')'
     Sparse tree for deadlines and scheduled items after a given date.

   Note that `org-schedule' and `org-deadline' supports setting the
date by indicating a relative time: e.g., +1d will set the date to the
next day after today, and -1w will set the date to the previous week
before any current timestamp.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The `SCHEDULED' and `DEADLINE' dates are inserted on the line
right below the headline.  Don't put any text between this line and the

`lognotereschedule', and `nologreschedule'


File: org,  Node: Repeated tasks,  Prev: Inserting deadline/schedule,  Up: Deadlines and scheduling

8.3.2 Repeated tasks
--------------------

Some tasks need to be repeated again and again.  Org mode helps to
organize such tasks using a so-called repeater in a DEADLINE, SCHEDULED,
or plain timestamp.  In the following example
     ** TODO Pay the rent
        DEADLINE: <2005-10-01 Sat +1m>
   the `+1m' is a repeater; the intended interpretation is that the task
has a deadline on <2005-10-01> and repeats itself every (one) month
starting from that time.  You can use yearly, monthly, weekly, daily
and hourly repeat cookies by using the `y/w/m/d/h' letters.  If you
need both a repeater and a special warning period in a deadline entry,
the repeater should come first and the warning period last: `DEADLINE:
<2005-10-01 Sat +1m -3d>'.

   Deadlines and scheduled items produce entries in the agenda when
they are over-due, so it is important to be able to mark such an entry
as completed once you have done so.  When you mark a DEADLINE or a
SCHEDULE with the TODO keyword DONE, it will no longer produce entries
in the agenda.  The problem with this is, however, that then also the
_next_ instance of the repeated entry will not be active.  Org mode
deals with this in the following way: When you try to mark such an
entry DONE (using `C-c C-t'), it will shift the base date of the
repeating timestamp by the repeater interval, and immediately set the
entry state back to TODO(1).  In the example above, setting the state
to DONE would actually switch the date like this:

     ** TODO Pay the rent
        DEADLINE: <2005-11-01 Tue +1m>

   A timestamp(2) will be added under the deadline, to keep a record
that you actually acted on the previous instance of this deadline.

   As a consequence of shifting the base date, this entry will no
longer be visible in the agenda when checking past dates, but all
future instances will be visible.

   With the `+1m' cookie, the date shift will always be exactly one
month.  So if you have not paid the rent for three months, marking this
entry DONE will still keep it as an overdue deadline.  Depending on the
task, this may not be the best way to handle it.  For example, if you
forgot to call your father for 3 weeks, it does not make sense to call
him 3 times in a single day to make up for it.  Finally, there are tasks
like changing batteries which should always repeat a certain time after
the last time you did it.  For these tasks, Org mode has special
repeaters  `++' and `.+'.  For example:

     ** TODO Call Father
        DEADLINE: <2008-02-10 Sun ++1w>
        Marking this DONE will shift the date by at least one week,
        but also by as many weeks as it takes to get this date into
        the future.  However, it stays on a Sunday, even if you called
        and marked it done on Saturday.
     ** TODO Check the batteries in the smoke detectors
        DEADLINE: <2005-11-01 Tue .+1m>
        Marking this DONE will shift the date to one month after
        today.

   You may have both scheduling and deadline information for a specific
task.  If the repeater is set for the scheduling information only, you
probably want the repeater to be ignored after the deadline.  If so,
set the variable `org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-deadline-is-shown' to
`repeated-after-deadline'.  If you want both scheduling and deadline
information to repeat after the same interval, set the same repeater
for both timestamps.

   An alternative to using a repeater is to create a number of copies
of a task subtree, with dates shifted in each copy.  The command `C-c
C-x c' was created for this purpose, it is described in *note Structure
editing::.

`REPEAT_TO_STATE' property or the variable `org-todo-repeat-to-state'.
If neither of these is specified, the target state defaults to the

   (2) You can change this using the option `org-log-repeat', or the
`#+STARTUP' options `logrepeat', `lognoterepeat', and `nologrepeat'.
With `lognoterepeat', you will also be prompted for a note.

8.4 Clocking work time
======================

Org mode allows you to clock the time you spend on specific tasks in a
project.  When you start working on an item, you can start the clock.
When you stop working on that task, or when you mark the task done, the
clock is stopped and the corresponding time interval is recorded.  It
also computes the total time spent on each subtree(1) of a project.
And it remembers a history or tasks recently clocked, to that you can
jump quickly between a number of tasks absorbing your time.

   To save the clock history across Emacs sessions, use
     (setq org-clock-persist 'history)
     (org-clock-persistence-insinuate)
   When you clock into a new task after resuming Emacs, the incomplete
clock(2) will be found (*note Resolving idle time::) and you will be
prompted about what to do with it.

* Menu:

* Clocking commands::           Starting and stopping a clock
* The clock table::             Detailed reports
* Resolving idle time::         Resolving time when you've been idle

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Clocking only works if all headings are indented with less than
30 stars.  This is a hardcoded limitation of `lmax' in `org-clock-sum'.

   (2) To resume the clock under the assumption that you have worked on
this task while outside Emacs, use `(setq org-clock-persist t)'.


File: org,  Node: Clocking commands,  Next: The clock table,  Prev: Clocking work time,  Up: Clocking work time

8.4.1 Clocking commands
-----------------------

`C-c C-x C-i     (`org-clock-in')'
     Start the clock on the current item (clock-in).  This inserts the
     CLOCK keyword together with a timestamp.  If this is not the first
     clocking of this item, the multiple CLOCK lines will be wrapped
     into a `:LOGBOOK:' drawer (see also the variable
     `org-clock-into-drawer').  You can also overrule the setting of
     this variable for a subtree by setting a `CLOCK_INTO_DRAWER' or
     `LOG_INTO_DRAWER' property.  When called with a `C-u' prefix
     argument, select the task from a list of recently clocked tasks.
     With two `C-u C-u' prefixes, clock into the task at point and mark
     it as the default task; the default task will then always be
     available with letter `d' when selecting a clocking task.  With
     three `C-u C-u C-u' prefixes, force continuous clocking by
     starting the clock when the last clock stopped.
     While the clock is running, the current clocking time is shown in
     the mode line, along with the title of the task.  The clock time
     shown will be all time ever clocked for this task and its
     children.  If the task has an effort estimate (*note Effort
     estimates::), the mode line displays the current clocking time
     against it(1)  If the task is a repeating one (*note Repeated
     tasks::), only the time since the last reset of the task (2) will
     be shown.  More control over what time is shown can be exercised
     with the `CLOCK_MODELINE_TOTAL' property.  It may have the values
     `current' to show only the current clocking instance, `today' to
     show all time clocked on this tasks today (see also the variable
     `org-extend-today-until'), `all' to include all time, or `auto'
     which is the default(3).
     Clicking with `mouse-1' onto the mode line entry will pop up a
     menu with clocking options.  

`C-c C-x C-o     (`org-clock-out')'
     Stop the clock (clock-out).  This inserts another timestamp at the
     same location where the clock was last started.  It also directly
     computes the resulting time in inserts it after the time range as
     `=> HH:MM'.  See the variable `org-log-note-clock-out' for the
     possibility to record an additional note together with the
     clock-out timestamp(4).  

`C-c C-x C-x     (`org-clock-in-last')'
     Reclock the last clocked task.  With one `C-u' prefix argument,
     select the task from the clock history.  With two `C-u' prefixes,
     force continuous clocking by starting the clock when the last clock
     stopped.  

`C-c C-x C-e     (`org-clock-modify-effort-estimate')'
     Update the effort estimate for the current clock task.  

`C-c C-c  or  C-c C-y     (`org-evaluate-time-range')'
     Recompute the time interval after changing one of the timestamps.
     This is only necessary if you edit the timestamps directly.  If
     you change them with `S-<cursor>' keys, the update is automatic.  

`C-S-<up/down>     (`org-clock-timestamps-up/down')'
     On `CLOCK' log lines, increase/decrease both timestamps so that the
     clock duration keeps the same.  

`S-M-<up/down>     (`org-timestamp-up/down')'
     On `CLOCK' log lines, increase/decrease the timestamp at point and
     the one of the previous (or the next clock) timestamp by the same
     duration.  For example, if you hit `S-M-<up>' to increase a
     clocked-out timestamp by five minutes, then the clocked-in
     timestamp of the next clock will be increased by five minutes.  

`C-c C-t     (`org-todo')'
     Changing the TODO state of an item to DONE automatically stops the
     clock if it is running in this same item.  

`C-c C-x C-q     (`org-clock-cancel')'
     Cancel the current clock.  This is useful if a clock was started by
     mistake, or if you ended up working on something else.  

`C-c C-x C-j     (`org-clock-goto')'
     Jump to the headline of the currently clocked in task.  With a
     `C-u' prefix arg, select the target task from a list of recently
     clocked tasks.  

`C-c C-x C-d     (`org-clock-display')'
     Display time summaries for each subtree in the current buffer.
     This puts overlays at the end of each headline, showing the total
     time recorded under that heading, including the time of any
     subheadings.  You can use visibility cycling to study the tree,
     but the overlays disappear when you change the buffer (see
     variable `org-remove-highlights-with-change') or press `C-c C-c'.

   The `l' key may be used in the timeline (*note Timeline::) and in
the agenda (*note Weekly/daily agenda::) to show which tasks have been
worked on or closed during a day.

   *Important:* note that both `org-clock-out' and `org-clock-in-last'
can have a global keybinding and will not modify the window disposition.

8.4.2 The clock table
---------------------

Org mode can produce quite complex reports based on the time clocking
information.  Such a report is called a _clock table_, because it is
formatted as one or several Org tables.

`C-c C-x C-r     (`org-clock-report')'
     Insert a dynamic block (*note Dynamic blocks::) containing a clock
     report as an Org mode table into the current file.  When the
     cursor is at an existing clock table, just update it.  When called
     with a prefix argument, jump to the first clock report in the
     current document and update it.  The clock table always includes
     also trees with `:ARCHIVE:' tag.  

`C-c C-c  or  C-c C-x C-u     (`org-dblock-update')'
     Update dynamic block at point.  The cursor needs to be in the
     `#+BEGIN' line of the dynamic block.  

`C-u C-c C-x C-u'
     Update all dynamic blocks (*note Dynamic blocks::).  This is
     useful if you have several clock table blocks in a buffer.  

`S-<left>'
`S-<right>     (`org-clocktable-try-shift')'
     Shift the current `:block' interval and update the table.  The
     cursor needs to be in the `#+BEGIN: clocktable' line for this
     command.  If `:block' is `today', it will be shifted to `today-1'
     etc.

   Here is an example of the frame for a clock table as it is inserted
into the buffer with the `C-c C-x C-r' command:

     #+BEGIN: clocktable :maxlevel 2 :emphasize nil :scope file
     #+END: clocktable
   The `BEGIN' line and specify a number of options to define the scope,
structure, and formatting of the report.  Defaults for all these
options can be configured in the variable `org-clocktable-defaults'.

First there are options that determine which clock entries are to be
selected:
     :maxlevel    Maximum level depth to which times are listed in the table.
                  Clocks at deeper levels will be summed into the upper level.
     :scope       The scope to consider.  This can be any of the following:
                  nil        the current buffer or narrowed region
                  file       the full current buffer
                  subtree    the subtree where the clocktable is located
                  treeN      the surrounding level N tree, for example `tree3'
                  tree       the surrounding level 1 tree
                  agenda     all agenda files
                  ("file"..) scan these files
                  file-with-archives    current file and its archives
                  agenda-with-archives  all agenda files, including archives
     :block       The time block to consider.  This block is specified either
                  absolute, or relative to the current time and may be any of
                  these formats:
                  2007-12-31    New year eve 2007
                  2007-12       December 2007
                  2007-W50      ISO-week 50 in 2007
                  2007-Q2       2nd quarter in 2007
                  2007          the year 2007
                  today, yesterday, today-N          a relative day
                  thisweek, lastweek, thisweek-N     a relative week
                  thismonth, lastmonth, thismonth-N  a relative month
                  thisyear, lastyear, thisyear-N     a relative year
                  Use `S-<left>/<right>' keys to shift the time interval.
     :tstart      A time string specifying when to start considering times.
                  Relative times like `"<-2w>"' can also be used.  See
                  *note Matching tags and properties:: for relative time syntax.
     :tend        A time string specifying when to stop considering times.
                  Relative times like `"<now>"' can also be used.  See
                  *note Matching tags and properties:: for relative time syntax.
     :wstart      The starting day of the week.  The default is 1 for monday.
     :mstart      The starting day of the month.  The default 1 is for the first
                  day of the month.
     :step        `week' or `day', to split the table into chunks.
                  To use this, `:block' or `:tstart', `:tend' are needed.
     :stepskip0   Do not show steps that have zero time.
     :fileskip0   Do not show table sections from files which did not contribute.
     :tags        A tags match to select entries that should contribute.  See
                  *note Matching tags and properties:: for the match syntax.

   Then there are options which determine the formatting of the table.
There options are interpreted by the function
`org-clocktable-write-default', but you can specify your own function
using the `:formatter' parameter.
     :emphasize   When `t', emphasize level one and level two items.
     :lang        Language(1) to use for descriptive cells like "Task".
     :link        Link the item headlines in the table to their origins.
     :narrow      An integer to limit the width of the headline column in
                  the org table.  If you write it like `50!', then the
                  headline will also be shortened in export.
     :indent      Indent each headline field according to its level.
     :tcolumns    Number of columns to be used for times.  If this is smaller
                  than `:maxlevel', lower levels will be lumped into one column.
     :level       Should a level number column be included?
     :compact     Abbreviation for `:level nil :indent t :narrow 40! :tcolumns 1'
                  All are overwritten except if there is an explicit `:narrow'
     :timestamp   A timestamp for the entry, when available.  Look for SCHEDULED,
                  DEADLINE, TIMESTAMP and TIMESTAMP_IA, in this order.
     :properties  List of properties that should be shown in the table.  Each
                  property will get its own column.
     :inherit-props When this flag is `t', the values for `:properties' will be inherited.
     :formula     Content of a `#+TBLFM' line to be added and evaluated.
                  As a special case, `:formula %' adds a column with % time.
                  If you do not specify a formula here, any existing formula
                  below the clock table will survive updates and be evaluated.
     :formatter   A function to format clock data and insert it into the buffer.
   To get a clock summary of the current level 1 tree, for the current
day, you could write
     #+BEGIN: clocktable :maxlevel 2 :block today :scope tree1 :link t
     #+END: clocktable
   and to use a specific time range you could write(2)
     #+BEGIN: clocktable :tstart "<2006-08-10 Thu 10:00>"
                         :tend "<2006-08-10 Thu 12:00>"
     #+END: clocktable
   A range starting a week ago and ending right now could be written as
     #+BEGIN: clocktable :tstart "<-1w>" :tend "<now>"
     #+END: clocktable
   A summary of the current subtree with % times would be
     #+BEGIN: clocktable :scope subtree :link t :formula %
     #+END: clocktable
   A horizontally compact representation of everything clocked during
last week would be
     #+BEGIN: clocktable :scope agenda :block lastweek :compact t
     #+END: clocktable

8.4.3 Resolving idle time and continuous clocking
-------------------------------------------------

Resolving idle time
...................

If you clock in on a work item, and then walk away from your
computer--perhaps to take a phone call--you often need to "resolve" the
time you were away by either subtracting it from the current clock, or
applying it to another one.

   By customizing the variable `org-clock-idle-time' to some integer,
such as 10 or 15, Emacs can alert you when you get back to your
computer after being idle for that many minutes(1), and ask what you
want to do with the idle time.  There will be a question waiting for
you when you get back, indicating how much idle time has passed
(constantly updated with the current amount), as well as a set of
choices to correct the discrepancy:

`k'
     To keep some or all of the minutes and stay clocked in, press `k'.
     Org will ask how many of the minutes to keep.  Press <RET> to keep
     them all, effectively changing nothing, or enter a number to keep
     that many minutes.

`K'
     If you use the shift key and press `K', it will keep however many
     minutes you request and then immediately clock out of that task.
     If you keep all of the minutes, this is the same as just clocking
     out of the current task.

`s'
     To keep none of the minutes, use `s' to subtract all the away time
     from the clock, and then check back in from the moment you
     returned.

`S'
     To keep none of the minutes and just clock out at the start of the
     away time, use the shift key and press `S'.  Remember that using
     shift will always leave you clocked out, no matter which option
     you choose.

`C'
     To cancel the clock altogether, use `C'.  Note that if instead of
     canceling you subtract the away time, and the resulting clock
     amount is less than a minute, the clock will still be canceled
     rather than clutter up the log with an empty entry.

   What if you subtracted those away minutes from the current clock,
and now want to apply them to a new clock?  Simply clock in to any task
immediately after the subtraction.  Org will notice that you have
subtracted time "on the books", so to speak, and will ask if you want
to apply those minutes to the next task you clock in on.

   There is one other instance when this clock resolution magic occurs.
Say you were clocked in and hacking away, and suddenly your cat chased
a mouse who scared a hamster that crashed into your UPS's power button!
You suddenly lose all your buffers, but thanks to auto-save you still
have your recent Org mode changes, including your last clock in.

   If you restart Emacs and clock into any task, Org will notice that
you have a dangling clock which was never clocked out from your last
session.  Using that clock's starting time as the beginning of the
unaccounted-for period, Org will ask how you want to resolve that time.
The logic and behavior is identical to dealing with away time due to
idleness; it is just happening due to a recovery event rather than a
set amount of idle time.

   You can also check all the files visited by your Org agenda for
dangling clocks at any time using `M-x org-resolve-clocks RET' (or `C-c
C-x C-z').

Continuous clocking
...................

You may want to start clocking from the time when you clocked out the
previous task.  To enable this systematically, set
`org-clock-continuously' to `t'.  Each time you clock in, Org retrieves
the clock-out time of the last clocked entry for this session, and
start the new clock from there.

   If you only want this from time to time, use three universal prefix
arguments with `org-clock-in' and two `C-u C-u' with
`org-clock-in-last'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) On computers using Mac OS X, idleness is based on actual user
idleness, not just Emacs' idle time.  For X11, you can install a
utility program `x11idle.c', available in the `contrib/scripts'
directory of the Org git distribution, or install the `xprintidle'
package and set it to the variable `org-clock-x11idle-program-name' if
you are running Debian, to get the same general treatment of idleness.
On other systems, idle time refers to Emacs idle time only.


File: org,  Node: Effort estimates,  Next: Relative timer,  Prev: Clocking work time,  Up: Dates and Times

8.5 Effort estimates
====================

If you want to plan your work in a very detailed way, or if you need to
produce offers with quotations of the estimated work effort, you may
want to assign effort estimates to entries.  If you are also clocking
your work, you may later want to compare the planned effort with the
actual working time, a great way to improve planning estimates.  Effort
estimates are stored in a special property `Effort'(1).  You can set
the effort for an entry with the following commands:

`C-c C-x e     (`org-set-effort')'
     Set the effort estimate for the current entry.  With a numeric
     prefix argument, set it to the Nth allowed value (see below).
     This command is also accessible from the agenda with the `e' key.  

`C-c C-x C-e     (`org-clock-modify-effort-estimate')'
     Modify the effort estimate of the item currently being clocked.

   Clearly the best way to work with effort estimates is through column
view (*note Column view::).  You should start by setting up discrete
values for effort estimates, and a `COLUMNS' format that displays these
values together with clock sums (if you want to clock your time).  For
a specific buffer you can use

     #+PROPERTY: Effort_ALL 0 0:10 0:30 1:00 2:00 3:00 4:00 5:00 6:00 7:00
     #+COLUMNS: %40ITEM(Task) %17Effort(Estimated Effort){:} %CLOCKSUM

or, even better, you can set up these values globally by customizing the
variables `org-global-properties' and `org-columns-default-format'.  In
particular if you want to use this setup also in the agenda, a global
setup may be advised.

   The way to assign estimates to individual items is then to switch to
column mode, and to use `S-<right>' and `S-<left>' to change the value.
The values you enter will immediately be summed up in the hierarchy.
In the column next to it, any clocked time will be displayed.

   If you switch to column view in the daily/weekly agenda, the effort
column will summarize the estimated work effort for each day(2), and
you can use this to find space in your schedule.  To get an overview of
the entire part of the day that is committed, you can set the option
`org-agenda-columns-add-appointments-to-effort-sum'.  The appointments
on a day that take place over a specified time interval will then also
be added to the load estimate of the day.

   Effort estimates can be used in secondary agenda filtering that is
triggered with the `/' key in the agenda (*note Agenda commands::).  If
you have these estimates defined consistently, two or three key presses
will narrow down the list to stuff that fits into an available time
slot.

   (1) You may change the property being used with the variable
`org-effort-property'.

   (2) Please note the pitfalls of summing hierarchical data in a flat
list (*note Agenda column view::).

8.6 Taking notes with a relative timer
======================================

When taking notes during, for example, a meeting or a video viewing, it
can be useful to have access to times relative to a starting time.  Org
provides such a relative timer and make it easy to create timed notes.

`C-c C-x .     (`org-timer')'
     Insert a relative time into the buffer.  The first time you use
     this, the timer will be started.  When called with a prefix
     argument, the timer is restarted.  

`C-c C-x -     (`org-timer-item')'
     Insert a description list item with the current relative time.
     With a prefix argument, first reset the timer to 0.  

`M-<RET>     (`org-insert-heading')'
     Once the timer list is started, you can also use `M-<RET>' to
     insert new timer items.  

`C-c C-x ,'
     Pause the timer, or continue it if it is already paused
     (`org-timer-pause-or-continue').  

`C-u C-c C-x ,'
     Stop the timer.  After this, you can only start a new timer, not
     continue the old one.  This command also removes the timer from
     the mode line.  

`C-c C-x 0     (`org-timer-start')'
     Reset the timer without inserting anything into the buffer.  By
     default, the timer is reset to 0.  When called with a `C-u'
     prefix, reset the timer to specific starting offset.  The user is
     prompted for the offset, with a default taken from a timer string
     at point, if any, So this can be used to restart taking notes
     after a break in the process.  When called with a double prefix
     argument `C-u C-u', change all timer strings in the active region
     by a certain amount.  This can be used to fix timer strings if the
     timer was not started at exactly the right moment.

8.7 Countdown timer
===================

Calling `org-timer-set-timer' from an Org mode buffer runs a countdown
timer.  Use `;' from agenda buffers, <C-c C-x ;> everywhere else.

   `org-timer-set-timer' prompts the user for a duration and displays a
countdown timer in the modeline.  `org-timer-default-timer' sets the
default countdown value.  Giving a prefix numeric argument overrides
this default value.

9 Capture - Refile - Archive
****************************

An important part of any organization system is the ability to quickly
capture new ideas and tasks, and to associate reference material with
them.  Org does this using a process called capture.  It also can store
files related to a task (attachments) in a special directory.  Once in
the system, tasks and projects need to be moved around.  Moving
completed project trees to an archive file keeps the system compact and
fast.

9.1 Capture
===========

Capture lets you quickly store notes with little interruption of your
work flow.  Org's method for capturing new items is heavily inspired by
John Wiegley excellent `remember.el' package.  Up to version 6.36, Org
used a special setup for `remember.el', then replaced it with
`org-remember.el'.  As of version 8.0, `org-remember.el' has been
completely replaced by `org-capture.el'.

   If your configuration depends on `org-remember.el', you need to
update it and use the setup described below.  To convert your
`org-remember-templates', run the command
     M-x org-capture-import-remember-templates RET
   and then customize the new variable with `M-x customize-variable
org-capture-templates', check the result, and save the customization.

* Setting up capture::          Where notes will be stored
* Using capture::               Commands to invoke and terminate capture
* Capture templates::           Define the outline of different note types

9.1.1 Setting up capture
------------------------

The following customization sets a default target file for notes, and
defines a global key(1)  for capturing new material.

     (setq org-default-notes-file (concat org-directory "/notes.org"))
     (define-key global-map "\C-cc" 'org-capture)

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Please select your own key, `C-c c' is only a suggestion.


File: org,  Node: Using capture,  Next: Capture templates,  Prev: Setting up capture,  Up: Capture

9.1.2 Using capture
-------------------

`C-c c     (`org-capture')'
     Call the command `org-capture'.  Note that this keybinding is
     global and not active by default: you need to install it.  If you
     have templates defined *note Capture templates::, it will offer
     these templates for selection or use a new Org outline node as the
     default template.  It will insert the template into the target
     file and switch to an indirect buffer narrowed to this new node.
     You may then insert the information you want.

`C-c C-c     (`org-capture-finalize')'
     Once you have finished entering information into the capture
     buffer, `C-c C-c' will return you to the window configuration
     before the capture process, so that you can resume your work
     without further distraction.  When called with a prefix arg,
     finalize and then jump to the captured item.

`C-c C-w     (`org-capture-refile')'
     Finalize the capture process by refiling (*note Refile and copy::)
     the note to a different place.  Please realize that this is a
     normal refiling command that will be executed--so the cursor
     position at the moment you run this command is important.  If you
     have inserted a tree with a parent and children, first move the
     cursor back to the parent.  Any prefix argument given to this
     command will be passed on to the `org-refile' command.

`C-c C-k     (`org-capture-kill')'
     Abort the capture process and return to the previous state.


   You can also call `org-capture' in a special way from the agenda,
using the `k c' key combination.  With this access, any timestamps
inserted by the selected capture template will default to the cursor
date in the agenda, rather than to the current date.

   To find the locations of the last stored capture, use `org-capture'
with prefix commands:

`C-u C-c c'
     Visit the target location of a capture template.  You get to
     select the template in the usual way.  

`C-u C-u C-c c'
     Visit the last stored capture item in its buffer.

   You can also jump to the bookmark `org-capture-last-stored', which
will automatically be created unless you set `org-capture-bookmark' to
`nil'.

   To insert the capture at point in an Org buffer, call `org-capture'
with a `C-0' prefix argument.


File: org,  Node: Capture templates,  Prev: Using capture,  Up: Capture

9.1.3 Capture templates
-----------------------

You can use templates for different types of capture items, and for
different target locations.  The easiest way to create such templates is
through the customize interface.

`C-c c C'
     Customize the variable `org-capture-templates'.

   Before we give the formal description of template definitions, let's
look at an example.  Say you would like to use one template to create
general TODO entries, and you want to put these entries under the
heading `Tasks' in your file `~/org/gtd.org'.  Also, a date tree in the
file `journal.org' should capture journal entries.  A possible
configuration would look like:

     (setq org-capture-templates
      '(("t" "Todo" entry (file+headline "~/org/gtd.org" "Tasks")
             "* TODO %?\n  %i\n  %a")
        ("j" "Journal" entry (file+datetree "~/org/journal.org")
             "* %?\nEntered on %U\n  %i\n  %a")))

If you then press `C-c c t', Org will prepare the template for you like
this:
     * TODO
       [[file:LINK TO WHERE YOU INITIATED CAPTURE]]

During expansion of the template, `%a' has been replaced by a link to
the location from where you called the capture command.  This can be
extremely useful for deriving tasks from emails, for example.  You fill
in the task definition, press `C-c C-c' and Org returns you to the same
place where you started the capture process.

   To define special keys to capture to a particular template without
going through the interactive template selection, you can create your
key binding like this:

     (define-key global-map "\C-cx"
        (lambda () (interactive) (org-capture nil "x")))

* Menu:

* Template elements::           What is needed for a complete template entry
* Template expansion::          Filling in information about time and context
* Templates in contexts::       Only show a template in a specific context


File: org,  Node: Template elements,  Next: Template expansion,  Prev: Capture templates,  Up: Capture templates

9.1.3.1 Template elements
.........................

Now lets look at the elements of a template definition.  Each entry in
`org-capture-templates' is a list with the following items:

KEYS
     The keys that will select the template, as a string, characters
     only, for example `"a"' for a template to be selected with a
     single key, or `"bt"' for selection with two keys.  When using
     several keys, keys using the same prefix key must be sequential in
     the list and preceded by a 2-element entry explaining the prefix
     key, for example
                   ("b" "Templates for marking stuff to buy")
     If you do not define a template for the `C' key, this key will be
     used to open the customize buffer for this complex variable.

DESCRIPTION
     A short string describing the template, which will be shown during
     selection.

TYPE
     The type of entry, a symbol.  Valid values are:

    `entry'
          An Org mode node, with a headline.  Will be filed as the
          child of the target entry or as a top-level entry.  The
          target file should be an Org mode file.

    `item'
          A plain list item, placed in the first plain  list at the
          target location.  Again the target file should be an Org file.

    `checkitem'
          A checkbox item.  This only differs from the plain list item
          by the default template.

    `table-line'
          a new line in the first table at the target location.  Where
          exactly the line will be inserted depends on the properties
          `:prepend' and `:table-line-pos' (see below).

    `plain'
          Text to be inserted as it is.

TARGET
     Specification of where the captured item should be placed.  In Org
     mode files, targets usually define a node.  Entries will become
     children of this node.  Other types will be added to the table or
     list in the body of this node.  Most target specifications contain
     a file name.  If that file name is the empty string, it defaults
     to `org-default-notes-file'.  A file can also be given as a
     variable, function, or Emacs Lisp form.

     Valid values are:

    `(file "path/to/file")'
          Text will be placed at the beginning or end of that file.

    `(id "id of existing org entry")'
          Filing as child of this entry, or in the body of the entry.

    `(file+headline "path/to/file" "node headline")'
          Fast configuration if the target heading is unique in the
          file.

    `(file+olp "path/to/file" "Level 1 heading" "Level 2" ...)'
          For non-unique headings, the full path is safer.

    `(file+regexp  "path/to/file" "regexp to find location")'
          Use a regular expression to position the cursor.

    `(file+datetree "path/to/file")'
          Will create a heading in a date tree for today's date(1).

    `(file+datetree+prompt "path/to/file")'
          Will create a heading in a date tree, but will prompt for the
          date.

    `(file+function "path/to/file" function-finding-location)'
          A function to find the right location in the file.

    `(clock)'
          File to the entry that is currently being clocked.

    `(function function-finding-location)'
          Most general way, write your own function to find both file
          and location.

TEMPLATE
     The template for creating the capture item.  If you leave this
     empty, an appropriate default template will be used.  Otherwise
     this is a string with escape codes, which will be replaced
     depending on time and context of the capture call.  The string
     with escapes may be loaded from a template file, using the special
     syntax `(file "path/to/template")'.  See below for more details.

PROPERTIES
     The rest of the entry is a property list of additional options.
     Recognized properties are:

    `:prepend'
          Normally new captured information will be appended at the
          target location (last child, last table line, last list
          item...).  Setting this property will change that.

    `:immediate-finish'
          When set, do not offer to edit the information, just file it
          away immediately.  This makes sense if the template only needs
          information that can be added automatically.

    `:empty-lines'
          Set this to the number of lines to insert before and after
          the new item.  Default 0, only common other value is 1.

    `:clock-in'
          Start the clock in this item.

    `:clock-keep'
          Keep the clock running when filing the captured entry.

    `:clock-resume'
          If starting the capture interrupted a clock, restart that
          clock when finished with the capture.  Note that
          `:clock-keep' has precedence over `:clock-resume'.  When
          setting both to `t', the current clock will run and the
          previous one will not be resumed.

    `:unnarrowed'
          Do not narrow the target buffer, simply show the full buffer.
          Default is to narrow it so that you only see the new material.

    `:table-line-pos'
          Specification of the location in the table where the new line
          should be inserted.  It should be a string like `"II-3"'
          meaning that the new line should become the third line before
          the second horizontal separator line.

    `:kill-buffer'
          If the target file was not yet visited when capture was
          invoked, kill the buffer again after capture is completed.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Datetree headlines for years accept tags, so if you use both `*
2013 :noexport:' and `* 2013' in your file, the capture will refile the
note to the first one matched.

9.1.3.2 Template expansion
..........................

In the template itself, special `%'-escapes(1) allow dynamic insertion
of content.  The templates are expanded in the order given here:

     %[FILE]     Insert the contents of the file given by FILE.
     %(SEXP)     Evaluate Elisp SEXP and replace with the result.
                       For convenience, %:keyword (see below) placeholders
                       within the expression will be expanded prior to this.
                       The sexp must return a string.
     %<...>      The result of format-time-string on the ... format specification.
     %t          Timestamp, date only.
     %T          Timestamp, with date and time.
     %u, %U      Like the above, but inactive timestamps.
     %i          Initial content, the region when capture is called while the
                 region is active.
                 The entire text will be indented like `%i' itself.
     %a          Annotation, normally the link created with `org-store-link'.
     %A          Like `%a', but prompt for the description part.
     %l          Like %a, but only insert the literal link.
     %c          Current kill ring head.
     %x          Content of the X clipboard.
     %k          Title of the currently clocked task.
     %K          Link to the currently clocked task.
     %n          User name (taken from `user-full-name').
     %f          File visited by current buffer when org-capture was called.
     %F          Full path of the file or directory visited by current buffer.
     %:keyword   Specific information for certain link types, see below.
     %^g         Prompt for tags, with completion on tags in target file.
     %^G         Prompt for tags, with completion all tags in all agenda files.
     %^t         Like `%t', but prompt for date.  Similarly `%^T', `%^u', `%^U'.
                 You may define a prompt like `%^{Birthday}t'.
     %^C         Interactive selection of which kill or clip to use.
     %^L         Like `%^C', but insert as link.
     %^{PROP}p   Prompt the user for a value for property PROP.
     %^{PROMPT}  prompt the user for a string and replace this sequence with it.
                 You may specify a default value and a completion table with
                 %^{prompt|default|completion2|completion3...}.
                 The arrow keys access a prompt-specific history.
     %\n         Insert the text entered at the nth %^{PROMPT}, where `n' is
                 a number, starting from 1.
     %?          After completing the template, position cursor here.

For specific link types, the following keywords will be defined(2):

     Link type                        |  Available keywords
     ---------------------------------+----------------------------------------------
     bbdb                             |  %:name %:company

                                      |  %:to   %:toname   %:toaddress
                                      |  %:date (message date header field)
                                      |  %:date-timestamp (date as active timestamp)
                                      |  %:date-timestamp-inactive (date as inactive timestamp)
                                      |  %:fromto (either "to NAME" or "from NAME")(3)
     gnus                             |  %:group, for messages also all email fields
     w3, w3m                          |  %:url
     info                             |  %:file %:node
     calendar                         |  %:date

To place the cursor after template expansion use:

     %?          After completing the template, position cursor here.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If you need one of these sequences literally, escape the `%'
with a backslash.

   (2) If you define your own link types (*note Adding hyperlink
types::), any property you store with `org-store-link-props' can be
accessed in capture templates in a similar way.

   (3) This will always be the other, not the user.  See the variable
`org-from-is-user-regexp'.


File: org,  Node: Templates in contexts,  Prev: Template expansion,  Up: Capture templates

9.1.3.3 Templates in contexts
.............................

To control whether a capture template should be accessible from a
specific context, you can customize `org-capture-templates-contexts'.
Let's say for example that you have a capture template `"p"' for
storing Gnus emails containing patches.  Then you would configure this
option like this:

     (setq org-capture-templates-contexts
           '(("p" (in-mode . "message-mode"))))

   You can also tell that the command key `"p"' should refer to another
template.  In that case, add this command key like this:

     (setq org-capture-templates-contexts
           '(("p" "q" (in-mode . "message-mode"))))

   See the docstring of the variable for more information.

9.2 Attachments
===============

It is often useful to associate reference material with an outline
node/task.  Small chunks of plain text can simply be stored in the
subtree of a project.  Hyperlinks (*note Hyperlinks::) can establish
associations with files that live elsewhere on your computer or in the
cloud, like emails or source code files belonging to a project.
Another method is attachments, which are files located in a directory
belonging to an outline node.  Org uses directories named by the unique
ID of each entry.  These directories are located in the `data'
directory which lives in the same directory where your Org file
lives(1).  If you initialize this directory with `git init', Org will
automatically commit changes when it sees them.  The attachment system
has been contributed to Org by John Wiegley.

   In cases where it seems better to do so, you can also attach a
directory of your choice to an entry.  You can also make children
inherit the attachment directory from a parent, so that an entire
subtree uses the same attached directory.

The following commands deal with attachments:

`C-c C-a     (`org-attach')'
     The dispatcher for commands related to the attachment system.
     After these keys, a list of commands is displayed and you must
     press an additional key to select a command:

    `a     (`org-attach-attach')'
          Select a file and move it into the task's attachment
          directory.  The file will be copied, moved, or linked,
          depending on `org-attach-method'.  Note that hard links are
          not supported on all systems.

    `c/m/l'
          Attach a file using the copy/move/link method.  Note that
          hard links are not supported on all systems.

    `n     (`org-attach-new')'
          Create a new attachment as an Emacs buffer.

    `z     (`org-attach-sync')'
          Synchronize the current task with its attachment directory,
          in case you added attachments yourself.

    `o     (`org-attach-open')'
          Open current task's attachment.  If there is more than one,
          prompt for a file name first.  Opening will follow the rules
          set by `org-file-apps'.  For more details, see the
          information on following hyperlinks (*note Handling links::).

    `O     (`org-attach-open-in-emacs')'
          Also open the attachment, but force opening the file in Emacs.

    `f     (`org-attach-reveal')'
          Open the current task's attachment directory.

    `F     (`org-attach-reveal-in-emacs')'
          Also open the directory, but force using `dired' in Emacs.

    `d     (`org-attach-delete-one')'
          Select and delete a single attachment.

    `D     (`org-attach-delete-all')'
          Delete all of a task's attachments.  A safer way is to open
          the directory in `dired' and delete from there.

    `s     (`org-attach-set-directory')'
          Set a specific directory as the entry's attachment directory.
          This works by putting the directory path into the
          `ATTACH_DIR' property.

    `i     (`org-attach-set-inherit')'
          Set the `ATTACH_DIR_INHERIT' property, so that children will
          use the same directory for attachments as the parent does.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If you move entries or Org files from one directory to another,
you may want to configure `org-attach-directory' to contain an absolute
path.

9.3 RSS feeds
=============

Org can add and change entries based on information found in RSS feeds
and Atom feeds.  You could use this to make a task out of each new
podcast in a podcast feed.  Or you could use a phone-based
note-creating service on the web to import tasks into Org.  To access
feeds, configure the variable `org-feed-alist'.  The docstring of this
variable has detailed information.  Here is just an example:

     (setq org-feed-alist
          '(("Slashdot"
              "http://rss.slashdot.org/Slashdot/slashdot"
              "~/txt/org/feeds.org" "Slashdot Entries")))

will configure that new items from the feed provided by
`rss.slashdot.org' will result in new entries in the file
`~/org/feeds.org' under the heading `Slashdot Entries', whenever the
following command is used:

`C-c C-x g     (`org-feed-update-all')'

`C-c C-x g'
     Collect items from the feeds configured in `org-feed-alist' and
     act upon them.  

`C-c C-x G     (`org-feed-goto-inbox')'
     Prompt for a feed name and go to the inbox configured for this
     feed.

   Under the same headline, Org will create a drawer `FEEDSTATUS' in
which it will store information about the status of items in the feed,
to avoid adding the same item several times.  You should add
`FEEDSTATUS' to the list of drawers in that file:

     #+DRAWERS: LOGBOOK PROPERTIES FEEDSTATUS

   For more information, including how to read atom feeds, see
`org-feed.el' and the docstring of `org-feed-alist'.

9.4 Protocols for external access
=================================

You can set up Org for handling protocol calls from outside
applications that are passed to Emacs through the `emacsserver'.  For
example, you can configure bookmarks in your web browser to send a link
to the current page to Org and create a note from it using capture
(*note Capture::).  Or you could create a bookmark that will tell Emacs
to open the local source file of a remote website you are looking at
with the browser.  See
`http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.php' for detailed
documentation and setup instructions.

9.5 Refile and copy
===================

When reviewing the captured data, you may want to refile or to copy
some of the entries into a different list, for example into a project.
Cutting, finding the right location, and then pasting the note is
cumbersome.  To simplify this process, you can use the following
special command:

`C-c M-w     (`org-copy')'
     Copying works like refiling, except that the original note is not
     deleted.  

`C-c C-w     (`org-refile')'
     Refile the entry or region at point.  This command offers possible
     locations for refiling the entry and lets you select one with
     completion.  The item (or all items in the region) is filed below
     the target heading as a subitem.  Depending on
     `org-reverse-note-order', it will be either the first or last
     subitem.
     By default, all level 1 headlines in the current buffer are
     considered to be targets, but you can have more complex
     definitions across a number of files.  See the variable
     `org-refile-targets' for details.  If you would like to select a
     location via a file-path-like completion along the outline path,
     see the variables `org-refile-use-outline-path' and
     `org-outline-path-complete-in-steps'.  If you would like to be
     able to create new nodes as new parents for refiling on the fly,
     check the variable `org-refile-allow-creating-parent-nodes'.  When
     the variable `org-log-refile'(1) is set, a timestamp or a note
     will be recorded when an entry has been refiled.  

`C-u C-c C-w'
     Use the refile interface to jump to a heading.  

`C-u C-u C-c C-w     (`org-refile-goto-last-stored')'
     Jump to the location where `org-refile' last moved a tree to.

`C-2 C-c C-w'
     Refile as the child of the item currently being clocked.

`C-3 C-c C-w'
     Refile and keep the entry in place.  Also see `org-refile-keep' to
     make this the default behavior, and beware that this may result in
     duplicated `ID' properties.  

`C-0 C-c C-w  or  C-u C-u C-u C-c C-w     (`org-refile-cache-clear')'
     Clear the target cache.  Caching of refile targets can be turned
     on by setting `org-refile-use-cache'.  To make the command see new
     possible targets, you have to clear the cache with this command.

9.6 Archiving
=============

When a project represented by a (sub)tree is finished, you may want to
move the tree out of the way and to stop it from contributing to the
agenda.  Archiving is important to keep your working files compact and
global searches like the construction of agenda views fast.

`C-c C-x C-a     (`org-archive-subtree-default')'
     Archive the current entry using the command specified in the
     variable `org-archive-default-command'.

* Menu:

* Moving subtrees::             Moving a tree to an archive file
* Internal archiving::          Switch off a tree but keep it in the file


File: org,  Node: Moving subtrees,  Next: Internal archiving,  Prev: Archiving,  Up: Archiving

9.6.1 Moving a tree to the archive file
---------------------------------------

The most common archiving action is to move a project tree to another
file, the archive file.

`C-c C-x C-s  or short  C-c $     (`org-archive-subtree')'
     Archive the subtree starting at the cursor position to the location
     given by `org-archive-location'.  

`C-u C-c C-x C-s'
     Check if any direct children of the current headline could be
     moved to the archive.  To do this, each subtree is checked for
     open TODO entries.  If none are found, the command offers to move
     it to the archive location.  If the cursor is _not_ on a headline
     when this command is invoked, the level 1 trees will be checked.

   The default archive location is a file in the same directory as the
current file, with the name derived by appending `_archive' to the
current file name.  You can also choose what heading to file archived
items under, with the possibility to add them to a datetree in a file.
For information and examples on how to specify the file and the heading,
see the documentation string of the variable `org-archive-location'.

   There is also an in-buffer option for setting this variable, for
example(1):

     #+ARCHIVE: %s_done::

If you would like to have a special ARCHIVE location for a single entry
or a (sub)tree, give the entry an `:ARCHIVE:' property with the
location as the value (*note Properties and Columns::).

   When a subtree is moved, it receives a number of special properties
that record context information like the file from where the entry
came, its outline path the archiving time etc.  Configure the variable
`org-archive-save-context-info' to adjust the amount of information
added.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For backward compatibility, the following also works: If there
are several such lines in a file, each specifies the archive location
for the text below it.  The first such line also applies to any text
before its definition.  However, using this method is _strongly_
deprecated as it is incompatible with the outline structure of the
document.  The correct method for setting multiple archive locations in
a buffer is using properties.


File: org,  Node: Internal archiving,  Prev: Moving subtrees,  Up: Archiving

9.6.2 Internal archiving
------------------------

If you want to just switch off (for agenda views) certain subtrees
without moving them to a different file, you can use the `ARCHIVE tag'.

   A headline that is marked with the ARCHIVE tag (*note Tags::) stays
at its location in the outline tree, but behaves in the following way:
   - It does not open when you attempt to do so with a visibility
     cycling command (*note Visibility cycling::).  You can force
     cycling archived subtrees with `C-<TAB>', or by setting the option
     `org-cycle-open-archived-trees'.  Also normal outline commands like
     `show-all' will open archived subtrees.

   - During sparse tree construction (*note Sparse trees::), matches in
     archived subtrees are not exposed, unless you configure the option
     `org-sparse-tree-open-archived-trees'.

   - During agenda view construction (*note Agenda Views::), the
     content of archived trees is ignored unless you configure the
     option `org-agenda-skip-archived-trees', in which case these trees
     will always be included.  In the agenda you can press `v a' to get
     archives temporarily included.

   - Archived trees are not exported (*note Exporting::), only the
     headline is.  Configure the details using the variable
     `org-export-with-archived-trees'.

   - Archived trees are excluded from column view unless the variable
     `org-columns-skip-archived-trees' is configured to `nil'.

   The following commands help manage the ARCHIVE tag:

`C-c C-x a     (`org-toggle-archive-tag')'
     Toggle the ARCHIVE tag for the current headline.  When the tag is
     set, the headline changes to a shadowed face, and the subtree
     below it is hidden.  

`C-u C-c C-x a'
     Check if any direct children of the current headline should be
     archived.  To do this, each subtree is checked for open TODO
     entries.  If none are found, the command offers to set the ARCHIVE
     tag for the child.  If the cursor is _not_ on a headline when this
     command is invoked, the level 1 trees will be checked.  

`C-TAB     (`org-force-cycle-archived')'
     Cycle a tree even if it is tagged with ARCHIVE.  

`C-c C-x A     (`org-archive-to-archive-sibling')'
     Move the current entry to the _Archive Sibling_.  This is a
     sibling of the entry with the heading `Archive' and the tag
     `ARCHIVE'.  The entry becomes a child of that sibling and in this
     way retains a lot of its original context, including inherited
     tags and approximate position in the outline.

10 Agenda views
***************

Due to the way Org works, TODO items, time-stamped items, and tagged
headlines can be scattered throughout a file or even a number of files.
To get an overview of open action items, or of events that are
important for a particular date, this information must be collected,
sorted and displayed in an organized way.

   Org can select items based on various criteria and display them in a
separate buffer.  Seven different view types are provided:

   * an _agenda_ that is like a calendar and shows information for
     specific dates,

   * a _TODO list_ that covers all unfinished action items,

   * a _match view_, showings headlines based on the tags, properties,
     and TODO state associated with them,

   * a _timeline view_ that shows all events in a single Org file, in
     time-sorted view,

   * a _text search view_ that shows all entries from multiple files
     that contain specified keywords,

   * a _stuck projects view_ showing projects that currently don't move
     along, and

   * _custom views_ that are special searches and combinations of
     different views.

The extracted information is displayed in a special _agenda buffer_.
This buffer is read-only, but provides commands to visit the
corresponding locations in the original Org files, and even to edit
these files remotely.

   Two variables control how the agenda buffer is displayed and whether
the window configuration is restored when the agenda exits:
`org-agenda-window-setup' and `org-agenda-restore-windows-after-quit'.

* Menu:

* Agenda files::                Files being searched for agenda information
* Agenda dispatcher::           Keyboard access to agenda views
* Built-in agenda views::       What is available out of the box?
* Presentation and sorting::    How agenda items are prepared for display

File: org,  Node: Agenda files,  Next: Agenda dispatcher,  Prev: Agenda Views,  Up: Agenda Views

10.1 Agenda files
=================

The information to be shown is normally collected from all _agenda
files_, the files listed in the variable `org-agenda-files'(1).  If a
directory is part of this list, all files with the extension `.org' in
this directory will be part of the list.

   Thus, even if you only work with a single Org file, that file should
be put into the list(2).  You can customize `org-agenda-files', but the
easiest way to maintain it is through the following commands

`C-c [     (`org-agenda-file-to-front')'
     Add current file to the list of agenda files.  The file is added to
     the front of the list.  If it was already in the list, it is moved
     to the front.  With a prefix argument, file is added/moved to the
     end.  

`C-c ]     (`org-remove-file')'
     Remove current file from the list of agenda files.  

`C-'     (`org-cycle-agenda-files')'
`C-,'
     Cycle through agenda file list, visiting one file after the other.  

`M-x org-iswitchb RET'
     Command to use an `iswitchb'-like interface to switch to and
     between Org buffers.

The Org menu contains the current list of files and can be used to
visit any of them.

   If you would like to focus the agenda temporarily on a file not in
this list, or on just one file in the list, or even on only a subtree
in a file, then this can be done in different ways.  For a single
agenda command, you may press `<' once or several times in the
dispatcher (*note Agenda dispatcher::).  To restrict the agenda scope
for an extended period, use the following commands:

`C-c C-x <     (`org-agenda-set-restriction-lock')'
     Permanently restrict the agenda to the current subtree.  When with
     a prefix argument, or with the cursor before the first headline in
     a file, the agenda scope is set to the entire file.  This
     restriction remains in effect until removed with `C-c C-x >', or
     by typing either `<' or `>' in the agenda dispatcher.  If there is
     a window displaying an agenda view, the new restriction takes
     effect immediately.  

`C-c C-x >     (`org-agenda-remove-restriction-lock')'
     Remove the permanent restriction created by `C-c C-x <'.

When working with `speedbar.el', you can use the following commands in
the Speedbar frame:

`< in the speedbar frame     (`org-speedbar-set-agenda-restriction')'
     Permanently restrict the agenda to the item--either an Org file or
     a subtree in such a file--at the cursor in the Speedbar frame.  If
     there is a window displaying an agenda view, the new restriction
     takes effect immediately.  

`> in the speedbar frame     (`org-agenda-remove-restriction-lock')'
     Lift the restriction.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If the value of that variable is not a list, but a single file
name, then the list of agenda files will be maintained in that external
file.

   (2) When using the dispatcher, pressing `<' before selecting a
command will actually limit the command to the current file, and ignore
`org-agenda-files' until the next dispatcher command.

10.2 The agenda dispatcher
==========================

The views are created through a dispatcher, which should be bound to a
global key--for example `C-c a' (*note Activation::).  In the following
we will assume that `C-c a' is indeed how the dispatcher is accessed
and list keyboard access to commands accordingly.  After pressing `C-c
a', an additional letter is required to execute a command.  The
dispatcher offers the following default commands:

`a'
     Create the calendar-like agenda (*note Weekly/daily agenda::).

`t / T'
     Create a list of all TODO items (*note Global TODO list::).

`m / M'
     Create a list of headlines matching a TAGS expression (*note
     Matching tags and properties::).

`L'
     Create the timeline view for the current buffer (*note Timeline::).

`s'
     Create a list of entries selected by a boolean expression of
     keywords and/or regular expressions that must or must not occur in
     the entry.

`/'
     Search for a regular expression in all agenda files and
     additionally in the files listed in
     `org-agenda-text-search-extra-files'.  This uses the Emacs command
     `multi-occur'.  A prefix argument can be used to specify the
     number of context lines for each match, default is 1.

`# / !'
     Create a list of stuck projects (*note Stuck projects::).

`<'
     Restrict an agenda command to the current buffer(1).  After
     pressing `<', you still need to press the character selecting the
     command.

`< <'
     If there is an active region, restrict the following agenda
     command to the region.  Otherwise, restrict it to the current
     subtree(2).  After pressing `< <', you still need to press the
     character selecting the command.

`*'
     Toggle sticky agenda views.  By default, Org maintains only a
     single agenda buffer and rebuilds it each time you change the
     view, to make sure everything is always up to date.  If you switch
     between views often and the build time bothers you, you can turn
     on sticky agenda buffers (make this the default by customizing the
     variable `org-agenda-sticky').  With sticky agendas, the
     dispatcher only switches to the selected view, you need to update
     it by hand with `r' or `g'.  You can toggle sticky agenda view any
     time with `org-toggle-sticky-agenda'.

   You can also define custom commands that will be accessible through
the dispatcher, just like the default commands.  This includes the
possibility to create extended agenda buffers that contain several
blocks together, for example the weekly agenda, the global TODO list and
a number of special tags matches.  *Note Custom agenda views::.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For backward compatibility, you can also press `1' to restrict
to the current buffer.

   (2) For backward compatibility, you can also press `0' to restrict
to the current region/subtree.

File: org,  Node: Weekly/daily agenda,  Next: Global TODO list,  Prev: Built-in agenda views,  Up: Built-in agenda views

10.3.1 The weekly/daily agenda
------------------------------

The purpose of the weekly/daily _agenda_ is to act like a page of a
paper agenda, showing all the tasks for the current week or day.

`C-c a a     (`org-agenda-list')'
     Compile an agenda for the current week from a list of Org files.
     The agenda shows the entries for each day.  With a numeric
     prefix(1)  (like `C-u 2 1 C-c a a') you may set the number of days
     to be displayed.

   The default number of days displayed in the agenda is set by the
variable `org-agenda-span' (or the obsolete `org-agenda-ndays').  This
variable can be set to any number of days you want to see by default in
the agenda, or to a span name, such as `day', `week', `month' or
`year'.  For weekly agendas, the default is to start on the previous
monday (see `org-agenda-start-on-weekday').  You can also set the start
date using a date shift: `(setq org-agenda-start-day "+10d")' will
start the agenda ten days from today in the future.

   Remote editing from the agenda buffer means, for example, that you
can change the dates of deadlines and appointments from the agenda
buffer.  The commands available in the Agenda buffer are listed in
*note Agenda commands::.

Calendar/Diary integration
..........................

Emacs contains the calendar and diary by Edward M. Reingold.  The
calendar displays a three-month calendar with holidays from different
countries and cultures.  The diary allows you to keep track of
anniversaries, lunar phases, sunrise/set, recurrent appointments
(weekly, monthly) and more.  In this way, it is quite complementary to
Org.  It can be very useful to combine output from Org with the diary.

   In order to include entries from the Emacs diary into Org mode's
agenda, you only need to customize the variable

     (setq org-agenda-include-diary t)

After that, everything will happen automatically.  All diary entries
including holidays, anniversaries, etc., will be included in the agenda
buffer created by Org mode.  <SPC>, <TAB>, and <RET> can be used from
the agenda buffer to jump to the diary file in order to edit existing
diary entries.  The `i' command to insert new entries for the current
date works in the agenda buffer, as well as the commands `S', `M', and
`C' to display Sunrise/Sunset times, show lunar phases and to convert
to other calendars, respectively.  `c' can be used to switch back and
forth between calendar and agenda.

   If you are using the diary only for sexp entries and holidays, it is
faster to not use the above setting, but instead to copy or even move
the entries into an Org file.  Org mode evaluates diary-style sexp
entries, and does it faster because there is no overhead for first
creating the diary display.  Note that the sexp entries must start at
the left margin, no whitespace is allowed before them.  For example,
the following segment of an Org file will be processed and entries will
be made in the agenda:

     * Birthdays and similar stuff
     #+CATEGORY: Holiday
     %%(org-calendar-holiday)   ; special function for holiday names
     #+CATEGORY: Ann
     %%(org-anniversary 1956  5 14)(2) Arthur Dent is %d years old
     %%(org-anniversary 1869 10  2) Mahatma Gandhi would be %d years old

Anniversaries from BBDB
.......................

If you are using the Big Brothers Database to store your contacts, you
will very likely prefer to store anniversaries in BBDB rather than in a
separate Org or diary file.  Org supports this and will show BBDB
anniversaries as part of the agenda.  All you need to do is to add the
following to one of your agenda files:

     * Anniversaries
       :PROPERTIES:
       :CATEGORY: Anniv
       :END:
     %%(org-bbdb-anniversaries)

   You can then go ahead and define anniversaries for a BBDB record.
Basically, you need to press `C-o anniversary <RET>' with the cursor in
a BBDB record and then add the date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD' or
`MM-DD', followed by a space and the class of the anniversary
(`birthday' or `wedding', or a format string).  If you omit the class,
it will default to `birthday'.  Here are a few examples, the header for
the file `org-bbdb.el' contains more detailed information.

     1973-06-22
     06-22
     1955-08-02 wedding
     2008-04-14 %s released version 6.01 of org mode, %d years ago

   After a change to BBDB, or for the first agenda display during an
Emacs session, the agenda display will suffer a short delay as Org
updates its hash with anniversaries.  However, from then on things will
be very fast--much faster in fact than a long list of
`%%(diary-anniversary)' entries in an Org or Diary file.

Appointment reminders
.....................

Org can interact with Emacs appointments notification facility.  To add
the appointments of your agenda files, use the command
`org-agenda-to-appt'.  This command lets you filter through the list of
your appointments and add only those belonging to a specific category
or matching a regular expression.  It also reads a `APPT_WARNTIME'
property which will then override the value of
`appt-message-warning-time' for this appointment.  See the docstring
for details.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For backward compatibility, the universal prefix `C-u' causes
all TODO entries to be listed before the agenda.  This feature is
deprecated, use the dedicated TODO list, or a block agenda instead
(*note Block agenda::).

   (2) `org-anniversary' is just like `diary-anniversary', but the
argument order is always according to ISO and therefore independent of
the value of `calendar-date-style'.


File: org,  Node: Global TODO list,  Next: Matching tags and properties,  Prev: Weekly/daily agenda,  Up: Built-in agenda views

10.3.2 The global TODO list
---------------------------

The global TODO list contains all unfinished TODO items formatted and
collected into a single place.

`C-c a t     (`org-todo-list')'
     Show the global TODO list.  This collects the TODO items from all
     agenda files (*note Agenda Views::) into a single buffer.  By
     default, this lists items with a state the is not a DONE state.
     The buffer is in `agenda-mode', so there are commands to examine
     and manipulate the TODO entries directly from that buffer (*note
     Agenda commands::).  

`C-c a T     (`org-todo-list')'
     Like the above, but allows selection of a specific TODO keyword.
     You can also do this by specifying a prefix argument to `C-c a t'.
     You are prompted for a keyword, and you may also specify several
     keywords by separating them with `|' as the boolean OR operator.
     With a numeric prefix, the Nth keyword in `org-todo-keywords' is
     selected.  The `r' key in the agenda buffer regenerates it, and
     you can give a prefix argument to this command to change the
     selected TODO keyword, for example `3 r'.  If you often need a
     search for a specific keyword, define a custom command for it
     (*note Agenda dispatcher::).
     Matching specific TODO keywords can also be done as part of a tags
     search (*note Tag searches::).

   Remote editing of TODO items means that you can change the state of a
TODO entry with a single key press.  The commands available in the TODO
list are described in *note Agenda commands::.

   Normally the global TODO list simply shows all headlines with TODO
keywords.  This list can become very long.  There are two ways to keep
it more compact:
   - Some people view a TODO item that has been _scheduled_ for
     execution or have a _deadline_ (*note Timestamps::) as no longer
     _open_.  Configure the variables
     `org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled',
     `org-agenda-todo-ignore-deadlines',
     `org-agenda-todo-ignore-timestamp' and/or
     `org-agenda-todo-ignore-with-date' to exclude such items from the
     global TODO list.

   - TODO items may have sublevels to break up the task into subtasks.
     In such cases it may be enough to list only the highest level TODO
     headline and omit the sublevels from the global list.  Configure
     the variable `org-agenda-todo-list-sublevels' to get this behavior.

10.3.3 Matching tags and properties
-----------------------------------

If headlines in the agenda files are marked with _tags_ (*note Tags::),
or have properties (*note Properties and Columns::), you can select
headlines based on this metadata and collect them into an agenda
buffer.  The match syntax described here also applies when creating
sparse trees with `C-c / m'.

`C-c a m     (`org-tags-view')'
     Produce a list of all headlines that match a given set of tags.
     The command prompts for a selection criterion, which is a boolean
     logic expression with tags, like `+work+urgent-withboss' or
     `work|home' (*note Tags::).  If you often need a specific search,
     define a custom command for it (*note Agenda dispatcher::).  

`C-c a M     (`org-tags-view')'
     Like `C-c a m', but only select headlines that are also TODO items
     in a not-DONE state and force checking subitems (see variable
     `org-tags-match-list-sublevels').  To exclude scheduled/deadline
     items, see the variable
     `org-agenda-tags-todo-honor-ignore-options'.  Matching specific
     TODO keywords together with a tags match is also possible, see
     *note Tag searches::.

   The commands available in the tags list are described in *note
Agenda commands::.

Match syntax
............

A search string can use Boolean operators `&' for `AND' and `|' for
`OR'.  `&' binds more strongly than `|'.  Parentheses are not
implemented.  Each element in the search is either a tag, a regular
expression matching tags, or an expression like `PROPERTY OPERATOR
VALUE' with a comparison operator, accessing a property value.  Each
element may be preceded by `-', to select against it, and `+' is
syntactic sugar for positive selection.  The `AND' operator `&' is
optional when `+' or `-' is present.  Here are some examples, using
only tags.

`work'
     Select headlines tagged `:work:'.

`work&boss'
     Select headlines tagged `:work:' and `:boss:'.

`+work-boss'
     Select headlines tagged `:work:', but discard those also tagged
     `:boss:'.

`work|laptop'
     Selects lines tagged `:work:' or `:laptop:'.

`work|laptop+night'
     Like before, but require the `:laptop:' lines to be tagged also
     `:night:'.

   Instead of a tag, you may also specify a regular expression enclosed
in curly braces.  For example, `work+{^boss.*}' matches headlines that
contain the tag `:work:' and any tag starting with `boss'.

   Group tags (*note Tag groups::) are expanded as regular expressions.
E.g., if `:work:' is a group tag for the group `:work:lab:conf:', then
searching for `work' will search for `{\(?:work\|lab\|conf\)}' and
searching for `-work' will search for all headlines but those with one
of the tag in the group (i.e., `-{\(?:work\|lab\|conf\)}').

   You may also test for properties (*note Properties and Columns::) at
the same time as matching tags.  The properties may be real properties,
or special properties that represent other metadata (*note Special
properties::).  For example, the "property" `TODO' represents the TODO
keyword of the entry and the "property" `PRIORITY' represents the
PRIORITY keyword of the entry.  The ITEM special property cannot
currently be used in tags/property searches(1).

   Except the *note Special properties::, one other "property" can also
be used. `LEVEL' represents the level of an entry.  So a search
`+LEVEL=3+boss-TODO="DONE"' lists all level three headlines that have
the tag `boss' and are _not_ marked with the TODO keyword DONE.  In
buffers with `org-odd-levels-only' set, `LEVEL' does not count the
number of stars, but `LEVEL=2' will correspond to 3 stars etc.

   Here are more examples:

`work+TODO="WAITING"'
     Select `:work:'-tagged TODO lines with the specific TODO keyword
     `WAITING'.

`work+TODO="WAITING"|home+TODO="WAITING"'
     Waiting tasks both at work and at home.

   When matching properties, a number of different operators can be
used to test the value of a property.  Here is a complex example:

     +work-boss+PRIORITY="A"+Coffee="unlimited"+Effort<2         \
              +With={Sarah\|Denny}+SCHEDULED>="<2008-10-11>"

The type of comparison will depend on how the comparison value is
written:
   - If the comparison value is a plain number, a numerical comparison
     is done, and the allowed operators are `<', `=', `>', `<=', `>=',
     and `<>'.

   - If the comparison value is enclosed in double-quotes, a string
     comparison is done, and the same operators are allowed.

   - If the comparison value is enclosed in double-quotes _and_ angular
     brackets (like `DEADLINE<="<2008-12-24 18:30>"'), both values are
     assumed to be date/time specifications in the standard Org way,
     and the comparison will be done accordingly.  Special values that
     will be recognized are `"<now>"' for now (including time), and
     `"<today>"', and `"<tomorrow>"' for these days at 0:00 hours,
     i.e., without a time specification.  Also strings like `"<+5d>"'
     or `"<-2m>"' with units `d', `w', `m', and `y' for day, week,
     month, and year, respectively, can be used.

   - If the comparison value is enclosed in curly braces, a regexp
     match is performed, with `=' meaning that the regexp matches the
     property value, and `<>' meaning that it does not match.

   So the search string in the example finds entries tagged `:work:' but
not `:boss:', which also have a priority value `A', a `:Coffee:'
property with the value `unlimited', an `Effort' property that is
numerically smaller than 2, a `:With:' property that is matched by the
regular expression `Sarah\|Denny', and that are scheduled on or after
October 11, 2008.

   Accessing TODO, LEVEL, and CATEGORY during a search is fast.
Accessing any other properties will slow down the search.  However,
once you have paid the price by accessing one property, testing
additional properties is cheap again.

   You can configure Org mode to use property inheritance during a
search, but beware that this can slow down searches considerably.  See
*note Property inheritance::, for details.

   For backward compatibility, and also for typing speed, there is also
a different way to test TODO states in a search.  For this, terminate
the tags/property part of the search string (which may include several
terms connected with `|') with a `/' and then specify a Boolean
expression just for TODO keywords.  The syntax is then similar to that
for tags, but should be applied with care: for example, a positive
selection on several TODO keywords cannot meaningfully be combined with
boolean AND.  However, _negative selection_ combined with AND can be
meaningful.  To make sure that only lines are checked that actually
have any TODO keyword (resulting in a speed-up), use `C-c a M', or
equivalently start the TODO part after the slash with `!'.  Using `C-c
a M' or `/!' will not match TODO keywords in a DONE state.  Examples:

`work/WAITING'
     Same as `work+TODO="WAITING"'

`work/!-WAITING-NEXT'
     Select `:work:'-tagged TODO lines that are neither `WAITING' nor
     `NEXT'

`work/!+WAITING|+NEXT'
     Select `:work:'-tagged TODO lines that are either `WAITING' or
     `NEXT'.

10.3.4 Timeline for a single file
---------------------------------

The timeline summarizes all time-stamped items from a single Org mode
file in a _time-sorted view_.  The main purpose of this command is to
give an overview over events in a project.

`C-c a L     (`org-timeline')'
     Show a time-sorted view of the Org file, with all time-stamped
     items.  When called with a `C-u' prefix, all unfinished TODO
     entries (scheduled or not) are also listed under the current date.

The commands available in the timeline buffer are listed in *note
Agenda commands::.


File: org,  Node: Search view,  Next: Stuck projects,  Prev: Timeline,  Up: Built-in agenda views

10.3.5 Search view
------------------

This agenda view is a general text search facility for Org mode entries.
It is particularly useful to find notes.

`C-c a s     (`org-search-view')'
     This is a special search that lets you select entries by matching
     a substring or specific words using a boolean logic.
   For example, the search string `computer equipment' will find entries
that contain `computer equipment' as a substring.  If the two words are
separated by more space or a line break, the search will still match.
Search view can also search for specific keywords in the entry, using
Boolean logic.  The search string `+computer +wifi -ethernet
-{8\.11[bg]}' will search for note entries that contain the keywords
`computer' and `wifi', but not the keyword `ethernet', and which are
also not matched by the regular expression `8\.11[bg]', meaning to
exclude both 8.11b and 8.11g.  The first `+' is necessary to turn on
word search, other `+' characters are optional.  For more details, see
the docstring of the command `org-search-view'.

   Note that in addition to the agenda files, this command will also
search the files listed in `org-agenda-text-search-extra-files'.


File: org,  Node: Stuck projects,  Prev: Search view,  Up: Built-in agenda views

10.3.6 Stuck projects
---------------------

If you are following a system like David Allen's GTD to organize your
work, one of the "duties" you have is a regular review to make sure
that all projects move along.  A _stuck_ project is a project that has
no defined next actions, so it will never show up in the TODO lists Org
mode produces.  During the review, you need to identify such projects
and define next actions for them.

`C-c a #     (`org-agenda-list-stuck-projects')'
     List projects that are stuck.  

`C-c a !'
     Customize the variable `org-stuck-projects' to define what a stuck
     project is and how to find it.

   You almost certainly will have to configure this view before it will
work for you.  The built-in default assumes that all your projects are
level-2 headlines, and that a project is not stuck if it has at least
one entry marked with a TODO keyword TODO or NEXT or NEXTACTION.

   Let's assume that you, in your own way of using Org mode, identify
projects with a tag PROJECT, and that you use a TODO keyword MAYBE to
indicate a project that should not be considered yet.  Let's further
assume that the TODO keyword DONE marks finished projects, and that NEXT
and TODO indicate next actions.  The tag @SHOP indicates shopping and
is a next action even without the NEXT tag.  Finally, if the project
contains the special word IGNORE anywhere, it should not be listed
either.  In this case you would start by identifying eligible projects
with a tags/todo match(1) `+PROJECT/-MAYBE-DONE', and then check for
TODO, NEXT, @SHOP, and IGNORE in the subtree to identify projects that
are not stuck.  The correct customization for this is

     (setq org-stuck-projects
           '("+PROJECT/-MAYBE-DONE" ("NEXT" "TODO") ("@SHOP")
                                    "\\<IGNORE\\>"))

   Note that if a project is identified as non-stuck, the subtree of
this entry will still be searched for stuck projects.

10.4 Presentation and sorting
=============================

Before displaying items in an agenda view, Org mode visually prepares
the items and sorts them.  Each item occupies a single line.  The line
starts with a _prefix_ that contains the _category_ (*note Categories::)
of the item and other important information.  You can customize in which
column tags will be displayed through `org-agenda-tags-column'.  You can
also customize the prefix using the option `org-agenda-prefix-format'.
This prefix is followed by a cleaned-up version of the outline headline
associated with the item.

* Menu:

* Categories::                  Not all tasks are equal
* Time-of-day specifications::  How the agenda knows the time
* Sorting agenda items::        The order of things
* Filtering/limiting agenda items::  Dynamically narrow the agenda


File: org,  Node: Categories,  Next: Time-of-day specifications,  Prev: Presentation and sorting,  Up: Presentation and sorting

10.4.1 Categories
-----------------

The category is a broad label assigned to each agenda item.  By default,
the category is simply derived from the file name, but you can also
specify it with a special line in the buffer, like this(1):

     #+CATEGORY: Thesis

If you would like to have a special CATEGORY for a single entry or a
(sub)tree, give the entry a `:CATEGORY:' property with the special
category you want to apply as the value.

The display in the agenda buffer looks best if the category is not
longer than 10 characters.

You can set up icons for category by customizing the
`org-agenda-category-icon-alist' variable.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For backward compatibility, the following also works: if there
are several such lines in a file, each specifies the category for the
text below it.  The first category also applies to any text before the
first CATEGORY line.  However, using this method is _strongly_
deprecated as it is incompatible with the outline structure of the
document.  The correct method for setting multiple categories in a
buffer is using a property.


File: org,  Node: Time-of-day specifications,  Next: Sorting agenda items,  Prev: Categories,  Up: Presentation and sorting

10.4.2 Time-of-day specifications
---------------------------------

Org mode checks each agenda item for a time-of-day specification.  The
time can be part of the timestamp that triggered inclusion into the
agenda, for example as in `<2005-05-10 Tue 19:00>'.  Time ranges can be
specified with two timestamps, like
`<2005-05-10 Tue 20:30>--<2005-05-10 Tue 22:15>'.

   In the headline of the entry itself, a time(range) may also appear as
plain text (like `12:45' or a `8:30-1pm').  If the agenda integrates
the Emacs diary (*note Weekly/daily agenda::), time specifications in
diary entries are recognized as well.

   For agenda display, Org mode extracts the time and displays it in a
standard 24 hour format as part of the prefix.  The example times in
the previous paragraphs would end up in the agenda like this:

         8:30-13:00 Arthur Dent lies in front of the bulldozer
        12:45...... Ford Prefect arrives and takes Arthur to the pub
        19:00...... The Vogon reads his poem
        20:30-22:15 Marvin escorts the Hitchhikers to the bridge

   If the agenda is in single-day mode, or for the display of today, the
timed entries are embedded in a time grid, like

         8:00...... ------------------
         8:30-13:00 Arthur Dent lies in front of the bulldozer
        10:00...... ------------------
        12:00...... ------------------
        12:45...... Ford Prefect arrives and takes Arthur to the pub
        14:00...... ------------------
        16:00...... ------------------
        18:00...... ------------------
        19:00...... The Vogon reads his poem
        20:00...... ------------------
        20:30-22:15 Marvin escorts the Hitchhikers to the bridge

   The time grid can be turned on and off with the variable
`org-agenda-use-time-grid', and can be configured with
`org-agenda-time-grid'.

10.4.3 Sorting agenda items
---------------------------

Before being inserted into a view, the items are sorted.  How this is
done depends on the type of view.
   * For the daily/weekly agenda, the items for each day are sorted.
     The default order is to first collect all items containing an
     explicit time-of-day specification.  These entries will be shown
     at the beginning of the list, as a _schedule_ for the day.  After
     that, items remain grouped in categories, in the sequence given by
     `org-agenda-files'.  Within each category, items are sorted by
     priority (*note Priorities::), which is composed of the base
     priority (2000 for priority `A', 1000 for `B', and 0 for `C'),
     plus additional increments for overdue scheduled or deadline items.

   * For the TODO list, items remain in the order of categories, but
     within each category, sorting takes place according to priority
     (*note Priorities::).  The priority used for sorting derives from
     the priority cookie, with additions depending on how close an item
     is to its due or scheduled date.

   * For tags matches, items are not sorted at all, but just appear in
     the sequence in which they are found in the agenda files.

   Sorting can be customized using the variable
`org-agenda-sorting-strategy', and may also include criteria based on
the estimated effort of an entry (*note Effort estimates::).


File: org,  Node: Filtering/limiting agenda items,  Prev: Sorting agenda items,  Up: Presentation and sorting

10.4.4 Filtering/limiting agenda items
--------------------------------------

Agenda built-in or customized commands are statically defined.  Agenda
filters and limits provide two ways of dynamically narrowing down the
list of agenda entries: _fitlers_ and _limits_.  Filters only act on the
display of the items, while limits take effect before the list of agenda
entries is built.  Filter are more often used interactively, while
limits are mostly useful when defined as local variables within custom
agenda commands.

Filtering in the agenda
.......................

`/     (`org-agenda-filter-by-tag')'
     Filter the agenda view with respect to a tag and/or effort
     estimates.  The difference between this and a custom agenda
     command is that filtering is very fast, so that you can switch
     quickly between different filters without having to recreate the
     agenda.(1)

     You will be prompted for a tag selection letter; <SPC> will mean
     any tag at all.  Pressing <TAB> at that prompt will offer use
     completion to select a tag (including any tags that do not have a
     selection character).  The command then hides all entries that do
     not contain or inherit this tag.  When called with prefix arg,
     remove the entries that _do_ have the tag.  A second `/' at the
     prompt will turn off the filter and unhide any hidden entries.  If
     the first key you press is either `+' or `-', the previous filter
     will be narrowed by requiring or forbidding the selected
     additional tag.  Instead of pressing `+' or `-' after `/', you can
     also immediately use the `\' command.

     In order to filter for effort estimates, you should set up allowed
     efforts globally, for example
          (setq org-global-properties
              '(("Effort_ALL". "0 0:10 0:30 1:00 2:00 3:00 4:00")))
     You can then filter for an effort by first typing an operator, one
     of `<', `>', and `=', and then the one-digit index of an effort
     estimate in your array of allowed values, where `0' means the 10th
     value.  The filter will then restrict to entries with effort
     smaller-or-equal, equal, or larger-or-equal than the selected
     value.  If the digits 0-9 are not used as fast access keys to
     tags, you can also simply press the index digit directly without
     an operator.  In this case, `<' will be assumed.  For application
     of the operator, entries without a defined effort will be treated
     according to the value of `org-sort-agenda-noeffort-is-high'.  To
     filter for tasks without effort definition, press `?' as the
     operator.

     Org also supports automatic, context-aware tag filtering.  If the
     variable `org-agenda-auto-exclude-function' is set to a
     user-defined function, that function can decide which tags should
     be excluded from the agenda automatically.  Once this is set, the
     `/' command then accepts `RET' as a sub-option key and runs the
     auto exclusion logic.  For example, let's say you use a `Net' tag
     to identify tasks which need network access, an `Errand' tag for
     errands in town, and a `Call' tag for making phone calls.  You
     could auto-exclude these tags based on the availability of the
     Internet, and outside of business hours, with something like this:

          (defun org-my-auto-exclude-function (tag)
            (and (cond
                  ((string= tag "Net")
                   (/= 0 (call-process "/sbin/ping" nil nil nil
                                       "-c1" "-q" "-t1" "mail.gnu.org")))
                  ((or (string= tag "Errand") (string= tag "Call"))
                   (let ((hour (nth 2 (decode-time))))
                     (or (< hour 8) (> hour 21)))))
                 (concat "-" tag)))

          (setq org-agenda-auto-exclude-function 'org-my-auto-exclude-function)

`\     (`org-agenda-filter-by-tag-refine')'
     Narrow the current agenda filter by an additional condition.  When
     called with prefix arg, remove the entries that _do_ have the tag,
     or that do match the effort criterion.  You can achieve the same
     effect by pressing `+' or `-' as the first key after the `/'
     command.

`[ ] { }'

    in search view
          add new search words (`[' and `]') or new regular expressions
          (`{' and `}') to the query string.  The opening bracket/brace
          will add a positive search term prefixed by `+', indicating
          that this search term must occur/match in the entry.  The
          closing bracket/brace will add a negative search term which
          must not occur/match in the entry for it to be selected.

`<     (`org-agenda-filter-by-category')'
     Filter the current agenda view with respect to the category of the
     item at point.  Pressing `<' another time will remove this filter.
     You can add a filter preset through the option
     `org-agenda-category-filter-preset' (see below.)

`^     (`org-agenda-filter-by-top-headline')'
     Filter the current agenda view and only display the siblings and
     the parent headline of the one at point.

`=     (`org-agenda-filter-by-regexp')'
     Filter the agenda view by a regular expression: only show agenda
     entries matching the regular expression the user entered.  When
     called with a prefix argument, it will filter _out_ entries
     matching the regexp.  With two universal prefix arguments, it will
     remove all the regexp filters, which can be accumulated.  You can
     add a filter preset through the option
     `org-agenda-category-filter-preset' (see below.)

`|     (`org-agenda-filter-remove-all')'
     Remove all filters in the current agenda view.

Setting limits for the agenda
.............................

Here is a list of options that you can set, either globally, or locally
in your custom agenda views*note Custom agenda views::.

ORG-AGENDA-MAX-ENTRIES
     Limit the number of entries.

ORG-AGENDA-MAX-EFFORT
     Limit the duration of accumulated efforts (as minutes).

ORG-AGENDA-MAX-TODOS
     Limit the number of entries with TODO keywords.

ORG-AGENDA-MAX-TAGS
     Limit the number of tagged entries.

   When set to a positive integer, each option will exclude entries
from other categories: for example, `(setq org-agenda-max-effort 100)'
will limit the agenda to 100 minutes of effort and exclude any entry
that as no effort property.  If you want to include entries with no
effort property, use a negative value for `org-agenda-max-effort'.

   One useful setup is to use `org-agenda-max-entries' locally in a
custom command.  For example, this custom command will display the next
five entries with a `NEXT' TODO keyword.

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("n" todo "NEXT"
              ((org-agenda-max-entries 5)))))

   Once you mark one of these five entry as `DONE', rebuilding the
agenda will again the next five entries again, including the first
entry that was excluded so far.

   You can also dynamically set temporary limits(2):

`~     (`org-agenda-limit-interactively')'
     This prompts for the type of limit to apply and its value.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Custom commands can preset a filter by binding the variable
`org-agenda-tag-filter-preset' as an option.  This filter will then be
applied to the view and persist as a basic filter through refreshes and
more secondary filtering.  The filter is a global property of the
entire agenda view--in a block agenda, you should only set this in the
global options section, not in the section of an individual block.

   (2) Those temporary limits are lost when rebuilding the agenda.

10.5 Commands in the agenda buffer
==================================

Entries in the agenda buffer are linked back to the Org file or diary
file where they originate.  You are not allowed to edit the agenda
buffer itself, but commands are provided to show and jump to the
original entry location, and to edit the Org files "remotely" from the
agenda buffer.  In this way, all information is stored only once,
removing the risk that your agenda and note files may diverge.

   Some commands can be executed with mouse clicks on agenda lines.  For
the other commands, the cursor needs to be in the desired line.

Motion
......

`n     (`org-agenda-next-line')'
     Next line (same as <down> and `C-n').  

`p     (`org-agenda-previous-line')'
     Previous line (same as <up> and `C-p').

View/Go to Org file
...................

`<SPC>  or  mouse-3     (`org-agenda-show-and-scroll-up')'
     Display the original location of the item in another window.  With
     prefix arg, make sure that the entire entry is made visible in the
     outline, not only the heading.  

`L     (`org-agenda-recenter')'
     Display original location and recenter that window.  

`<TAB>  or  mouse-2     (`org-agenda-goto')'
     Go to the original location of the item in another window.  

`<RET>     (`org-agenda-switch-to')'
     Go to the original location of the item and delete other windows.  

`F     (`org-agenda-follow-mode')'
     Toggle Follow mode.  In Follow mode, as you move the cursor through
     the agenda buffer, the other window always shows the corresponding
     location in the Org file.  The initial setting for this mode in new
     agenda buffers can be set with the variable
     `org-agenda-start-with-follow-mode'.  

`C-c C-x b     (`org-agenda-tree-to-indirect-buffer')'
     Display the entire subtree of the current item in an indirect
     buffer.  With a numeric prefix argument N, go up to level N and
     then take that tree.  If N is negative, go up that many levels.
     With a `C-u' prefix, do not remove the previously used indirect
     buffer.

`C-c C-o     (`org-agenda-open-link')'
     Follow a link in the entry.  This will offer a selection of any
     links in the text belonging to the referenced Org node.  If there
     is only one link, it will be followed without a selection prompt.

Change display
..............

`A'
     Interactively select another agenda view and append it to the
     current view.  

`o'
     Delete other windows.  

`v d  or short  d     (`org-agenda-day-view')'
`v w  or short  w     (`org-agenda-week-view')'
`v t     (`org-agenda-fortnight-view')'
`v m     (`org-agenda-month-view')'
`v y     (`org-agenda-year-view')'
`v SPC     (`org-agenda-reset-view')'
     Switch to day/week/month/year view.  When switching to day or week
     view, this setting becomes the default for subsequent agenda
     refreshes.  Since month and year views are slow to create, they do
     not become the default.  A numeric prefix argument may be used to
     jump directly to a specific day of the year, ISO week, month, or
     year, respectively.  For example, `32 d' jumps to February 1st, `9
     w' to ISO week number 9.  When setting day, week, or month view, a
     year may be encoded in the prefix argument as well.  For example,
     `200712 w' will jump to week 12 in 2007.  If such a year
     specification has only one or two digits, it will be mapped to the
     interval 1938-2037.  `v <SPC>' will reset to what is set in
     `org-agenda-span'.  

`f     (`org-agenda-later')'
     Go forward in time to display the following
     `org-agenda-current-span' days.  For example, if the display
     covers a week, switch to the following week.  With prefix arg, go
     forward that many times `org-agenda-current-span' days.  

`b     (`org-agenda-earlier')'
     Go backward in time to display earlier dates.  

`.     (`org-agenda-goto-today')'
     Go to today.  

`j     (`org-agenda-goto-date')'
     Prompt for a date and go there.  

`J     (`org-agenda-clock-goto')'
     Go to the currently clocked-in task in the agenda buffer.  

`D     (`org-agenda-toggle-diary')'
     Toggle the inclusion of diary entries.  See *note Weekly/daily
     agenda::.  

`v l  or short  l     (`org-agenda-log-mode')'
     Toggle Logbook mode.  In Logbook mode, entries that were marked
     DONE while logging was on (variable `org-log-done') are shown in
     the agenda, as are entries that have been clocked on that day.
     You can configure the entry types that should be included in log
     mode using the variable `org-agenda-log-mode-items'.  When called
     with a `C-u' prefix, show all possible logbook entries, including
     state changes.  When called with two prefix arguments `C-u C-u',
     show only logging information, nothing else.  `v L' is equivalent
     to `C-u v l'.  

`v [  or short  [     (`org-agenda-manipulate-query-add')'
     Include inactive timestamps into the current view.  Only for
     weekly/daily agenda and timeline views.  

`v a     (`org-agenda-archives-mode')'
`v A     (`org-agenda-archives-mode 'files')'
     Toggle Archives mode.  In Archives mode, trees that are marked
     `ARCHIVED' are also scanned when producing the agenda.  When you
     use the capital `A', even all archive files are included.  To exit
     archives mode, press `v a' again.  

`v R  or short  R     (`org-agenda-clockreport-mode')'
     Toggle Clockreport mode.  In Clockreport mode, the daily/weekly
     agenda will always show a table with the clocked times for the
     time span and file scope covered by the current agenda view.  The
     initial setting for this mode in new agenda buffers can be set
     with the variable `org-agenda-start-with-clockreport-mode'.  By
     using a prefix argument when toggling this mode (i.e., `C-u R'),
     the clock table will not show contributions from entries that are
     hidden by agenda filtering(1).  See also the variable
     `org-clock-report-include-clocking-task'.  

`v c'
     Show overlapping clock entries, clocking gaps, and other clocking
     problems in the current agenda range.  You can then visit clocking
     lines and fix them manually.  See the variable
     `org-agenda-clock-consistency-checks' for information on how to
     customize the definition of what constituted a clocking problem.
     To return to normal agenda display, press `l' to exit Logbook mode.  

`v E  or short  E     (`org-agenda-entry-text-mode')'
     Toggle entry text mode.  In entry text mode, a number of lines
     from the Org outline node referenced by an agenda line will be
     displayed below the line.  The maximum number of lines is given by
     the variable `org-agenda-entry-text-maxlines'.  Calling this
     command with a numeric prefix argument will temporarily modify
     that number to the prefix value.  

`G     (`org-agenda-toggle-time-grid')'
     Toggle the time grid on and off.  See also the variables
     `org-agenda-use-time-grid' and `org-agenda-time-grid'.  

`r     (`org-agenda-redo')'
     Recreate the agenda buffer, for example to reflect the changes
     after modification of the timestamps of items with `S-<left>' and
     `S-<right>'.  When the buffer is the global TODO list, a prefix
     argument is interpreted to create a selective list for a specific
     TODO keyword.  

`g     (`org-agenda-redo')'
     Same as `r'.  

`C-x C-s  or short  s     (`org-save-all-org-buffers')'
     Save all Org buffers in the current Emacs session, and also the
     locations of IDs.  

`C-c C-x C-c     (`org-agenda-columns')'
     Invoke column view (*note Column view::) in the agenda buffer.
     The column view format is taken from the entry at point, or (if
     there is no entry at point), from the first entry in the agenda
     view.  So whatever the format for that entry would be in the
     original buffer (taken from a property, from a `#+COLUMNS' line,
     or from the default variable `org-columns-default-format'), will
     be used in the agenda.

`C-c C-x >     (`org-agenda-remove-restriction-lock')'
     Remove the restriction lock on the agenda, if it is currently
     restricted to a file or subtree (*note Agenda files::).

Secondary filtering and query editing
.....................................

     For a detailed description of these commands, see *note
     Filtering/limiting agenda items::.

`/     (`org-agenda-filter-by-tag')'
     Filter the agenda view with respect to a tag and/or effort
     estimates.

`\     (`org-agenda-filter-by-tag-refine')'
     Narrow the current agenda filter by an additional condition.

`<     (`org-agenda-filter-by-category')'
     Filter the current agenda view with respect to the category of the
     item at point.  Pressing `<' another time will remove this filter.

`^     (`org-agenda-filter-by-top-headline')'
     Filter the current agenda view and only display the siblings and
     the parent headline of the one at point.

`=     (`org-agenda-filter-by-regexp')'
     Filter the agenda view by a regular expression: only show agenda
     entries matching the regular expression the user entered.  When
     called with a prefix argument, it will filter _out_ entries
     matching the regexp.  With two universal prefix arguments, it will
     remove all the regexp filters, which can be accumulated.  You can
     add a filter preset through the option
     `org-agenda-category-filter-preset' (see below.)

`|     (`org-agenda-filter-remove-all')'
     Remove all filters in the current agenda view.

Remote editing
..............

`0--9'
     Digit argument.  

`C-_     (`org-agenda-undo')'
     Undo a change due to a remote editing command.  The change is
     undone both in the agenda buffer and in the remote buffer.  

`t     (`org-agenda-todo')'
     Change the TODO state of the item, both in the agenda and in the
     original org file.  

`C-S-<right>     (`org-agenda-todo-nextset')'

`C-S-<left>     (`org-agenda-todo-previousset')'
     Switch to the next/previous set of TODO keywords.  

`C-k     (`org-agenda-kill')'
     Delete the current agenda item along with the entire subtree
     belonging to it in the original Org file.  If the text to be
     deleted remotely is longer than one line, the kill needs to be
     confirmed by the user.  See variable `org-agenda-confirm-kill'.  

`C-c C-w     (`org-agenda-refile')'
     Refile the entry at point.  

`C-c C-x C-a  or short  a     (`org-agenda-archive-default-with-confirmation')'
     Archive the subtree corresponding to the entry at point using the
     default archiving command set in `org-archive-default-command'.
     When using the `a' key, confirmation will be required.  

`C-c C-x a     (`org-agenda-toggle-archive-tag')'
     Toggle the ARCHIVE tag for the current headline.  

`C-c C-x A     (`org-agenda-archive-to-archive-sibling')'
     Move the subtree corresponding to the current entry to its _archive
     sibling_.  

`C-c C-x C-s  or short  $     (`org-agenda-archive')'
     Archive the subtree corresponding to the current headline.  This
     means the entry will be moved to the configured archive location,
     most likely a different file.  

`T     (`org-agenda-show-tags')'
     Show all tags associated with the current item.  This is useful if
     you have turned off `org-agenda-show-inherited-tags', but still
     want to see all tags of a headline occasionally.  

`:     (`org-agenda-set-tags')'
     Set tags for the current headline.  If there is an active region
     in the agenda, change a tag for all headings in the region.  

`,'
     Set the priority for the current item (`org-agenda-priority').
     Org mode prompts for the priority character.  If you reply with
     <SPC>, the priority cookie is removed from the entry.  

`P     (`org-agenda-show-priority')'
     Display weighted priority of current item.  

`+  or  S-<up>     (`org-agenda-priority-up')'
     Increase the priority of the current item.  The priority is
     changed in the original buffer, but the agenda is not resorted.
     Use the `r' key for this.  

`-  or  S-<down>     (`org-agenda-priority-down')'
     Decrease the priority of the current item.  

`z  or  C-c C-z     (`org-agenda-add-note')'
     Add a note to the entry.  This note will be recorded, and then
     filed to the same location where state change notes are put.
     Depending on `org-log-into-drawer', this may be inside a drawer.  

`C-c C-a     (`org-attach')'
     Dispatcher for all command related to attachments.  

`C-c C-s     (`org-agenda-schedule')'
     Schedule this item.  With prefix arg remove the scheduling
     timestamp 

`C-c C-d     (`org-agenda-deadline')'
     Set a deadline for this item.  With prefix arg remove the deadline.  

`S-<right>     (`org-agenda-do-date-later')'
     Change the timestamp associated with the current line by one day
     into the future.  If the date is in the past, the first call to
     this command will move it to today.
     With a numeric prefix argument, change it by that many days.  For
     example, `3 6 5 S-<right>' will change it by a year.  With a `C-u'
     prefix, change the time by one hour.  If you immediately repeat
     the command, it will continue to change hours even without the
     prefix arg.  With a double `C-u C-u' prefix, do the same for
     changing minutes.
     The stamp is changed in the original Org file, but the change is
     not directly reflected in the agenda buffer.  Use `r' or `g' to
     update the buffer.  

`S-<left>     (`org-agenda-do-date-earlier')'
     Change the timestamp associated with the current line by one day
     into the past.  

`>     (`org-agenda-date-prompt')'
     Change the timestamp associated with the current line.  The key
     `>' has been chosen, because it is the same as `S-.'  on my
     keyboard.  

`I     (`org-agenda-clock-in')'
     Start the clock on the current item.  If a clock is running
     already, it is stopped first.  

`O     (`org-agenda-clock-out')'
     Stop the previously started clock.  

`X     (`org-agenda-clock-cancel')'
     Cancel the currently running clock.  

`J     (`org-agenda-clock-goto')'
     Jump to the running clock in another window.  

`k     (`org-agenda-capture')'
     Like `org-capture', but use the date at point as the default date
     for the capture template.  See `org-capture-use-agenda-date' to
     make this the default behavior of `org-capture'.  

Dragging agenda lines forward/backward
......................................

`M-<up>     (`org-agenda-drag-line-backward')'
     Drag the line at point backward one line(2).  With a numeric
     prefix argument, drag backward by that many lines.

`M-<down>     (`org-agenda-drag-line-forward')'
     Drag the line at point forward one line.  With a numeric prefix
     argument, drag forward by that many lines.

Bulk remote editing selected entries
....................................

`m     (`org-agenda-bulk-mark')'
     Mark the entry at point for bulk action.  With numeric prefix
     argument, mark that many successive entries.  

`*     (`org-agenda-bulk-mark-all')'
     Mark all visible agenda entries for bulk action.  

`u     (`org-agenda-bulk-unmark')'
     Unmark entry at point for bulk action.  

`U     (`org-agenda-bulk-remove-all-marks')'
     Unmark all marked entries for bulk action.  

`M-m     (`org-agenda-bulk-toggle')'
     Toggle mark of the entry at point for bulk action.  

`M-*     (`org-agenda-bulk-toggle-all')'
     Toggle marks of all visible entries for bulk action.  

`%     (`org-agenda-bulk-mark-regexp')'
     Mark entries matching a regular expression for bulk action.  

`B     (`org-agenda-bulk-action')'
     Bulk action: act on all marked entries in the agenda.  This will
     prompt for another key to select the action to be applied.  The
     prefix arg to `B' will be passed through to the `s' and `d'
     commands, to bulk-remove these special timestamps.  By default,
     marks are removed after the bulk.  If you want them to persist,
     set `org-agenda-bulk-persistent-marks' to `t' or hit `p' at the
     prompt.

    `*'
          Toggle persistent marks.

    `$'
          Archive all selected entries.

    `A'
          Archive entries by moving them to their respective archive
          siblings.

    `t'
          Change TODO state.  This prompts for a single TODO keyword
          and changes the state of all selected entries, bypassing
          blocking and suppressing logging notes (but not timestamps).

    `+'
          Add a tag to all selected entries.

    `-'
          Remove a tag from all selected entries.

    `s'
          Schedule all items to a new date.  To shift existing schedule
          dates by a fixed number of days, use something starting with
          double plus at the prompt, for example `++8d' or `++2w'.

    `d'
          Set deadline to a specific date.

    `r'
          Prompt for a single refile target and move all entries.  The
          entries will no longer be in the agenda; refresh (`g') to
          bring them back.

    `S'
          Reschedule randomly into the coming N days.  N will be
          prompted for.  With prefix arg (`C-u B S'), scatter only
          across weekdays.

    `f'
          Apply a function(3) to marked entries.  For example, the
          function below sets the CATEGORY property of the entries to
          web.

               (defun set-category ()
                 (interactive "P")
                 (let* ((marker (or (org-get-at-bol 'org-hd-marker)
                                    (org-agenda-error)))
                        (buffer (marker-buffer marker)))
                   (with-current-buffer buffer
                     (save-excursion
                       (save-restriction
                         (widen)
                         (goto-char marker)
                         (org-back-to-heading t)
                         (org-set-property "CATEGORY" "web"))))))

Calendar commands
.................

`c     (`org-agenda-goto-calendar')'
     Open the Emacs calendar and move to the date at the agenda cursor.  

`c     (`org-calendar-goto-agenda')'
     When in the calendar, compute and show the Org mode agenda for the
     date at the cursor.  

`i     (`org-agenda-diary-entry')'
     Insert a new entry into the diary, using the date at the cursor
     and (for block entries) the date at the mark.  This will add to
     the Emacs diary file(4), in a way similar to the `i' command in
     the calendar.  The diary file will pop up in another window, where
     you can add the entry.

     If you configure `org-agenda-diary-file' to point to an Org mode
     file, Org will create entries (in Org mode syntax) in that file
     instead.  Most entries will be stored in a date-based outline tree
     that will later make it easy to archive appointments from previous
     months/years.  The tree will be built under an entry with a
     `DATE_TREE' property, or else with years as top-level entries.
     Emacs will prompt you for the entry text--if you specify it, the
     entry will be created in `org-agenda-diary-file' without further
     interaction.  If you directly press <RET> at the prompt without
     typing text, the target file will be shown in another window for
     you to finish the entry there.  See also the `k r' command.  

`M     (`org-agenda-phases-of-moon')'
     Show the phases of the moon for the three months around current
     date.  

`S     (`org-agenda-sunrise-sunset')'
     Show sunrise and sunset times.  The geographical location must be
     set with calendar variables, see the documentation for the Emacs
     calendar.  

`C     (`org-agenda-convert-date')'
     Convert the date at cursor into many other cultural and historic
     calendars.  

`H     (`org-agenda-holidays')'
     Show holidays for three months around the cursor date.

`M-x org-icalendar-combine-agenda-files RET'
     Export a single iCalendar file containing entries from all agenda
     files.  This is a globally available command, and also available
     in the agenda menu.

Exporting to a file
...................

`C-x C-w     (`org-agenda-write')'
     Write the agenda view to a file.  Depending on the extension of
     the selected file name, the view will be exported as HTML (`.html'
     or `.htm'), Postscript (`.ps'), PDF (`.pdf'), Org (`.org') and
     plain text (any other extension).  When exporting to Org, only the
     body of original headlines are exported, not subtrees or inherited
     tags.  When called with a `C-u' prefix argument, immediately open
     the newly created file.  Use the variable
     `org-agenda-exporter-settings' to set options for `ps-print' and
     for `htmlize' to be used during export.

Quit and Exit
.............

`q     (`org-agenda-quit')'
     Quit agenda, remove the agenda buffer.  

`x     (`org-agenda-exit')'
     Exit agenda, remove the agenda buffer and all buffers loaded by
     Emacs for the compilation of the agenda.  Buffers created by the
     user to visit Org files will not be removed.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Only tags filtering will be respected here, effort filtering is
ignored.

   (2) Moving agenda lines does not persist after an agenda refresh and
does not modify the contributing `.org' files

   (3) You can also create persistent custom functions through
`org-agenda-bulk-custom-functions'.

   (4) This file is parsed for the agenda when
`org-agenda-include-diary' is set.

10.6 Custom agenda views
========================

Custom agenda commands serve two purposes: to store and quickly access
frequently used TODO and tags searches, and to create special composite
agenda buffers.  Custom agenda commands will be accessible through the
dispatcher (*note Agenda dispatcher::), just like the default commands.

* Menu:

* Storing searches::            Type once, use often
* Block agenda::                All the stuff you need in a single buffer
* Setting Options::             Changing the rules


File: org,  Node: Storing searches,  Next: Block agenda,  Prev: Custom agenda views,  Up: Custom agenda views

10.6.1 Storing searches
-----------------------

The first application of custom searches is the definition of keyboard
shortcuts for frequently used searches, either creating an agenda
buffer, or a sparse tree (the latter covering of course only the current
buffer).  

   Custom commands are configured in the variable
`org-agenda-custom-commands'.  You can customize this variable, for
example by pressing `C-c a C'.  You can also directly set it with Emacs
Lisp in `.emacs'.  The following example contains all valid agenda
views:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("x" agenda)
             ("y" agenda*)
             ("w" todo "WAITING")
             ("W" todo-tree "WAITING")
             ("u" tags "+boss-urgent")
             ("v" tags-todo "+boss-urgent")
             ("U" tags-tree "+boss-urgent")
             ("f" occur-tree "\\<FIXME\\>")
             ("h" . "HOME+Name tags searches") ; description for "h" prefix
             ("hl" tags "+home+Lisa")
             ("hp" tags "+home+Peter")
             ("hk" tags "+home+Kim")))

The initial string in each entry defines the keys you have to press
after the dispatcher command `C-c a' in order to access the command.
Usually this will be just a single character, but if you have many
similar commands, you can also define two-letter combinations where the
first character is the same in several combinations and serves as a
prefix key(1).  The second parameter is the search type, followed by
the string or regular expression to be used for the matching.  The
example above will therefore define:

`C-c a x'
     as a global search for agenda entries planned(2) this week/day.

`C-c a y'
     as a global search for agenda entries planned this week/day, but
     only those with an hour specification like `[h]h:mm'--think of
     them as appointments.

`C-c a w'
     as a global search for TODO entries with `WAITING' as the TODO
     keyword

`C-c a W'
     as the same search, but only in the current buffer and displaying
     the results as a sparse tree

`C-c a u'
     as a global tags search for headlines marked `:boss:' but not
     `:urgent:'

`C-c a v'
     as the same search as `C-c a u', but limiting the search to
     headlines that are also TODO items

`C-c a U'
     as the same search as `C-c a u', but only in the current buffer and
     displaying the result as a sparse tree

`C-c a f'
     to create a sparse tree (again: current buffer only) with all
     entries containing the word `FIXME'

`C-c a h'
     as a prefix command for a HOME tags search where you have to press
     an additional key (`l', `p' or `k') to select a name (Lisa, Peter,
     or Kim) as additional tag to match.

   Note that the `*-tree' agenda views need to be called from an Org
buffer as they operate on the current buffer only.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) You can provide a description for a prefix key by inserting a
cons cell with the prefix and the description.

   (2) _Planned_ means here that these entries have some planning
information attached to them, like a time-stamp, a scheduled or a
deadline string.  See `org-agenda-entry-types' on how to set what
planning information will be taken into account.

10.6.2 Block agenda
-------------------

Another possibility is the construction of agenda views that comprise
the results of _several_ commands, each of which creates a block in the
agenda buffer.  The available commands include `agenda' for the daily
or weekly agenda (as created with `C-c a a'), `alltodo' for the global
TODO list (as constructed with `C-c a t'), and the matching commands
discussed above: `todo', `tags', and `tags-todo'.  Here are two
examples:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("h" "Agenda and Home-related tasks"
              ((agenda "")
               (tags-todo "home")
               (tags "garden")))
             ("o" "Agenda and Office-related tasks"
              ((agenda "")
               (tags-todo "work")
               (tags "office")))))

This will define `C-c a h' to create a multi-block view for stuff you
need to attend to at home.  The resulting agenda buffer will contain
your agenda for the current week, all TODO items that carry the tag
`home', and also all lines tagged with `garden'.  Finally the command
`C-c a o' provides a similar view for office tasks.


File: org,  Node: Setting Options,  Prev: Block agenda,  Up: Custom agenda views

10.6.3 Setting options for custom commands
------------------------------------------

Org mode contains a number of variables regulating agenda construction
and display.  The global variables define the behavior for all agenda
commands, including the custom commands.  However, if you want to change
some settings just for a single custom view, you can do so.  Setting
options requires inserting a list of variable names and values at the
right spot in `org-agenda-custom-commands'.  For example:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("w" todo "WAITING"
              ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-down))
               (org-agenda-prefix-format "  Mixed: ")))
             ("U" tags-tree "+boss-urgent"
              ((org-show-following-heading nil)
               (org-show-hierarchy-above nil)))
             ("N" search ""
              ((org-agenda-files '("~org/notes.org"))
               (org-agenda-text-search-extra-files nil)))))

Now the `C-c a w' command will sort the collected entries only by
priority, and the prefix format is modified to just say `  Mixed: '
instead of giving the category of the entry.  The sparse tags tree of
`C-c a U' will now turn out ultra-compact, because neither the headline
hierarchy above the match, nor the headline following the match will be
shown.  The command `C-c a N' will do a text search limited to only a
single file.

   For command sets creating a block agenda,
`org-agenda-custom-commands' has two separate spots for setting
options.  You can add options that should be valid for just a single
command in the set, and options that should be valid for all commands in
the set.  The former are just added to the command entry; the latter
must come after the list of command entries.  Going back to the block
agenda example (*note Block agenda::), let's change the sorting strategy
for the `C-c a h' commands to `priority-down', but let's sort the
results for GARDEN tags query in the opposite order, `priority-up'.
This would look like this:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("h" "Agenda and Home-related tasks"
              ((agenda)
               (tags-todo "home")
               (tags "garden"
                     ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-up)))))
              ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-down))))
             ("o" "Agenda and Office-related tasks"
              ((agenda)
               (tags-todo "work")
               (tags "office")))))

   As you see, the values and parentheses setting is a little complex.
When in doubt, use the customize interface to set this variable--it
fully supports its structure.  Just one caveat: when setting options in
this interface, the _values_ are just Lisp expressions.  So if the
value is a string, you need to add the double-quotes around the value
yourself.

   To control whether an agenda command should be accessible from a
specific context, you can customize
`org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts'.  Let's say for example that you
have an agenda commands `"o"' displaying a view that you only need when
reading emails.  Then you would configure this option like this:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts
           '(("o" (in-mode . "message-mode"))))

   You can also tell that the command key `"o"' should refer to another
command key `"r"'.  In that case, add this command key like this:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts
           '(("o" "r" (in-mode . "message-mode"))))

   See the docstring of the variable for more information.


File: org,  Node: Exporting Agenda Views,  Next: Agenda column view,  Prev: Custom agenda views,  Up: Agenda Views

10.7 Exporting Agenda Views
===========================

If you are away from your computer, it can be very useful to have a
printed version of some agenda views to carry around.  Org mode can
export custom agenda views as plain text, HTML(1), Postscript, PDF(2),
and iCalendar files.  If you want to do this only occasionally, use the
command

`C-x C-w     (`org-agenda-write')'
     Write the agenda view to a file.  Depending on the extension of
     the selected file name, the view will be exported as HTML
     (extension `.html' or `.htm'), Postscript (extension `.ps'),
     iCalendar (extension `.ics'), or plain text (any other extension).
     Use the variable `org-agenda-exporter-settings' to set options for
     `ps-print' and for `htmlize' to be used during export, for example

          (setq org-agenda-exporter-settings
                '((ps-number-of-columns 2)
                  (ps-landscape-mode t)
                  (org-agenda-add-entry-text-maxlines 5)
                  (htmlize-output-type 'css)))

   If you need to export certain agenda views frequently, you can
associate any custom agenda command with a list of output file names
(3).  Here is an example that first defines custom commands for the
agenda and the global TODO list, together with a number of files to
which to export them.  Then we define two block agenda commands and
specify file names for them as well.  File names can be relative to the
current working directory, or absolute.

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("X" agenda "" nil ("agenda.html" "agenda.ps"))
             ("Y" alltodo "" nil ("todo.html" "todo.txt" "todo.ps"))
             ("h" "Agenda and Home-related tasks"
              ((agenda "")
               (tags-todo "home")
               (tags "garden"))
              nil
              ("~/views/home.html"))
             ("o" "Agenda and Office-related tasks"
              ((agenda)
               (tags-todo "work")
               (tags "office"))
              nil
              ("~/views/office.ps" "~/calendars/office.ics"))))

   The extension of the file name determines the type of export.  If it
is `.html', Org mode will use the `htmlize.el' package to convert the
buffer to HTML and save it to this file name.  If the extension is
`.ps', `ps-print-buffer-with-faces' is used to produce Postscript
output.  If the extension is `.ics', iCalendar export is run export
over all files that were used to construct the agenda, and limit the
export to entries listed in the agenda.  Any other extension produces a
plain ASCII file.

   The export files are _not_ created when you use one of those
commands interactively because this might use too much overhead.
Instead, there is a special command to produce _all_ specified files in
one step:

`C-c a e     (`org-store-agenda-views')'
     Export all agenda views that have export file names associated with
     them.

   You can use the options section of the custom agenda commands to also
set options for the export commands.  For example:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("X" agenda ""
              ((ps-number-of-columns 2)
               (ps-landscape-mode t)
               (org-agenda-prefix-format " [ ] ")
               (org-agenda-with-colors nil)
               (org-agenda-remove-tags t))
              ("theagenda.ps"))))

This command sets two options for the Postscript exporter, to make it
print in two columns in landscape format--the resulting page can be cut
in two and then used in a paper agenda.  The remaining settings modify
the agenda prefix to omit category and scheduling information, and
instead include a checkbox to check off items.  We also remove the tags
to make the lines compact, and we don't want to use colors for the
black-and-white printer.  Settings specified in
`org-agenda-exporter-settings' will also apply, but the settings in
`org-agenda-custom-commands' take precedence.

From the command line you may also use
     emacs -eval (org-batch-store-agenda-views) -kill
   or, if you need to modify some parameters(4)
     emacs -eval '(org-batch-store-agenda-views                      \
                   org-agenda-span (quote month)                     \
                   org-agenda-start-day "2007-11-01"                 \
                   org-agenda-include-diary nil                      \
                   org-agenda-files (quote ("~/org/project.org")))'  \
           -kill
   which will create the agenda views restricted to the file
`~/org/project.org', without diary entries and with a 30-day extent.

   You can also extract agenda information in a way that allows further
processing by other programs.  See *note Extracting agenda
information::, for more information.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) You need to install Hrvoje Niksic's `htmlize.el'.

   (2) To create PDF output, the ghostscript `ps2pdf' utility must be
installed on the system.  Selecting a PDF file will also create the
postscript file.

   (3) If you want to store standard views like the weekly agenda or
the global TODO list as well, you need to define custom commands for
them in order to be able to specify file names.

   (4) Quoting depends on the system you use, please check the FAQ for
examples.


File: org,  Node: Agenda column view,  Prev: Exporting Agenda Views,  Up: Agenda Views

10.8 Using column view in the agenda
====================================

Column view (*note Column view::) is normally used to view and edit
properties embedded in the hierarchical structure of an Org file.  It
can be quite useful to use column view also from the agenda, where
entries are collected by certain criteria.

`C-c C-x C-c     (`org-agenda-columns')'
     Turn on column view in the agenda.

   To understand how to use this properly, it is important to realize
that the entries in the agenda are no longer in their proper outline
environment.  This causes the following issues:

  1. Org needs to make a decision which `COLUMNS' format to use.  Since
     the entries in the agenda are collected from different files, and
     different files may have different `COLUMNS' formats, this is a
     non-trivial problem.  Org first checks if the variable
     `org-agenda-overriding-columns-format' is currently set, and if
     so, takes the format from there.  Otherwise it takes the format
     associated with the first item in the agenda, or, if that item
     does not have a specific format (defined in a property, or in its
     file), it uses `org-columns-default-format'.

  2. If any of the columns has a summary type defined (*note Column
     attributes::), turning on column view in the agenda will visit all
     relevant agenda files and make sure that the computations of this
     property are up to date.  This is also true for the special
     `CLOCKSUM' property.  Org will then sum the values displayed in
     the agenda.  In the daily/weekly agenda, the sums will cover a
     single day; in all other views they cover the entire block.  It is
     vital to realize that the agenda may show the same entry _twice_
     (for example as scheduled and as a deadline), and it may show two
     entries from the same hierarchy (for example a _parent_ and its
     _child_).  In these cases, the summation in the agenda will lead
     to incorrect results because some values will count double.

  3. When the column view in the agenda shows the `CLOCKSUM', that is
     always the entire clocked time for this item.  So even in the
     daily/weekly agenda, the clocksum listed in column view may
     originate from times outside the current view.  This has the
     advantage that you can compare these values with a column listing
     the planned total effort for a task--one of the major applications
     for column view in the agenda.  If you want information about
     clocked time in the displayed period use clock table mode (press
     `R' in the agenda).

  4. When the column view in the agenda shows the `CLOCKSUM_T', that is
     always today's clocked time for this item.  So even in the weekly
     agenda, the clocksum listed in column view only originates from
     today.  This lets you compare the time you spent on a task for
     today, with the time already spent (via `CLOCKSUM') and with the
     planned total effort for it.

11 Markup for rich export
*************************

When exporting Org mode documents, the exporter tries to reflect the
structure of the document as accurately as possible in the back-end.
Since export targets like HTML, LaTeX allow much richer formatting, Org
mode has rules on how to prepare text for rich export.  This section
summarizes the markup rules used in an Org mode buffer.

* Menu:

* Structural markup elements::  The basic structure as seen by the exporter
* Images and tables::           Images, tables and caption mechanism
* Literal examples::            Source code examples with special formatting
* Include files::               Include additional files into a document
* Index entries::               Making an index
* Macro replacement::           Use macros to create templates
* Embedded LaTeX::           LaTeX can be freely used inside Org documents
* Special blocks::              Containers targeted at export back-ends

File: org,  Node: Document title,  Next: Headings and sections,  Prev: Structural markup elements,  Up: Structural markup elements

Document title
--------------

The title of the exported document is taken from the special line

     #+TITLE: This is the title of the document

If this line does not exist, the title will be the name of the file
associated to buffer, without extension, or the buffer name.

   If you are exporting only a subtree, its heading will become the
title of the document.  If the subtree has a property `EXPORT_TITLE',
that will take precedence.


File: org,  Node: Headings and sections,  Next: Table of contents,  Prev: Document title,  Up: Structural markup elements

Headings and sections
---------------------

The outline structure of the document as described in *note Document
Structure::, forms the basis for defining sections of the exported
document.  However, since the outline structure is also used for (for
example) lists of tasks, only the first three outline levels will be
used as headings.  Deeper levels will become itemized lists.  You can
change the location of this switch globally by setting the variable
`org-export-headline-levels', or on a per-file basis with a line

     #+OPTIONS: H:4


File: org,  Node: Table of contents,  Next: Lists,  Prev: Headings and sections,  Up: Structural markup elements

Table of contents
-----------------

The table of contents is normally inserted directly before the first
headline of the file.  The depth of the table is by default the same as
the number of headline levels, but you can choose a smaller number, or
turn off the table of contents entirely, by configuring the variable
`org-export-with-toc', or on a per-file basis with a line like

     #+OPTIONS: toc:2          (only to two levels in TOC)
     #+OPTIONS: toc:nil        (no default TOC at all)

   If you would like to move the table of contents to a different
location, you should turn off the default table using
`org-export-with-toc' or `#+OPTIONS' and insert `#+TOC: headlines N' at
the desired location(s).

     #+OPTIONS: toc:nil        (no default TOC)
     ...
     #+TOC: headlines 2        (insert TOC here, with two headline levels)

   Multiple `#+TOC: headline' lines are allowed.  The same `TOC'
keyword can also generate a list of all tables (resp. all listings)
with a caption in the buffer.

     #+TOC: listings           (build a list of listings)
     #+TOC: tables             (build a list of tables)

   The headline's title usually determines its corresponding entry in a
table of contents.  However, it is possible to specify an alternative
title by setting `ALT_TITLE' property accordingly.  It will then be
used when building the table.


File: org,  Node: Lists,  Next: Paragraphs,  Prev: Table of contents,  Up: Structural markup elements

Lists

Plain lists as described in *note Plain lists::, are translated to the
back-end's syntax for such lists.  Most back-ends support unordered,
ordered, and description lists.


File: org,  Node: Paragraphs,  Next: Footnote markup,  Prev: Lists,  Up: Structural markup elements

Paragraphs, line breaks, and quoting
------------------------------------

Paragraphs are separated by at least one empty line.  If you need to
enforce a line break within a paragraph, use `\\' at the end of a line.

   To keep the line breaks in a region, but otherwise use normal
formatting, you can use this construct, which can also be used to
format poetry.

     #+BEGIN_VERSE
      Great clouds overhead
      Tiny black birds rise and fall
      Snow covers Emacs

          -- AlexSchroeder
     #+END_VERSE

   When quoting a passage from another document, it is customary to
format this as a paragraph that is indented on both the left and the
right margin.  You can include quotations in Org mode documents like
this:

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Everything should be made as simple as possible,
     but not any simpler -- Albert Einstein
     #+END_QUOTE

   If you would like to center some text, do it like this: 
     #+BEGIN_CENTER
     Everything should be made as simple as possible, \\
     but not any simpler
     #+END_CENTER


File: org,  Node: Footnote markup,  Next: Emphasis and monospace,  Prev: Paragraphs,  Up: Structural markup elements

Footnote markup
---------------

Footnotes defined in the way described in *note Footnotes::, will be
exported by all back-ends.  Org allows multiple references to the same
note, and multiple footnotes side by side.


File: org,  Node: Emphasis and monospace,  Next: Horizontal rules,  Prev: Footnote markup,  Up: Structural markup elements

Emphasis and monospace
----------------------

You can make words *bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, `=code=' and
`~verbatim~', and, if you must, `+strike-through+'.  Text in the code
and verbatim string is not processed for Org mode specific syntax, it
is exported verbatim.

   To turn off fontification for marked up text, you can set
`org-fontify-emphasized-text' to `nil'.  To narrow down the list of
available markup syntax, you can customize `org-emphasis-alist'.  To
fine tune what characters are allowed before and after the markup
characters, you can tweak `org-emphasis-regexp-components'.  Beware
that changing one of the above variables will no take effect until you
reload Org, for which you may need to restart Emacs.


File: org,  Node: Horizontal rules,  Next: Comment lines,  Prev: Emphasis and monospace,  Up: Structural markup elements

Horizontal rules
----------------

A line consisting of only dashes, and at least 5 of them, will be
exported as a horizontal line.


File: org,  Node: Comment lines,  Prev: Horizontal rules,  Up: Structural markup elements

Comment lines
-------------

Lines starting with zero or more whitespace characters followed by one
`#' and a whitespace are treated as comments and will never be exported.
Also entire subtrees starting with the word `COMMENT' will never be
exported.  Finally, regions surrounded by `#+BEGIN_COMMENT' ...
`#+END_COMMENT' will not be exported.

     Toggle the COMMENT keyword at the beginning of an entry.


File: org,  Node: Images and tables,  Next: Literal examples,  Prev: Structural markup elements,  Up: Markup

11.2 Images and Tables
======================

Both the native Org mode tables (*note Tables::) and tables formatted
with the `table.el' package will be exported properly.  For Org mode
tables, the lines before the first horizontal separator line will
become table header lines.  You can use the following lines somewhere
before the table to assign a caption and a label for cross references,
and in the text you can refer to the object with `[[tab:basic-data]]'
(*note Internal links::):

     #+CAPTION: This is the caption for the next table (or link)
     #+NAME:   tab:basic-data
        | ... | ...|
        |-----|----|

   Optionally, the caption can take the form:
     #+CAPTION[Caption for list of tables]: Caption for table.

   Some back-ends allow you to directly include images into the exported
document.  Org does this, if a link to an image files does not have a
description part, for example `[[./img/a.jpg]]'.  If you wish to define
a caption for the image and maybe a label for internal cross
references, make sure that the link is on a line by itself and precede
it with `#+CAPTION' and `#+NAME' as follows:

     #+CAPTION: This is the caption for the next figure link (or table)
     #+NAME:   fig:SED-HR4049
     [[./img/a.jpg]]

Such images can be displayed within the buffer.  *Note the discussion
of image links: Handling links.

   Even though images and tables are prominent examples of captioned
structures, the same caption mechanism can apply to many others (e.g.,
LaTeX equations, source code blocks).  Depending on the export
back-end, those may or may not be handled.

11.3 Literal examples
=====================

You can include literal examples that should not be subjected to
markup.  Such examples will be typeset in monospace, so this is well
suited for source code and similar examples.  

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     Some example from a text file.
     #+END_EXAMPLE

   Note that such blocks may be indented in order to align nicely with
indented text and in particular with plain list structure (*note Plain
lists::).  For simplicity when using small examples, you can also start
the example lines with a colon followed by a space.  There may also be
additional whitespace before the colon:

     Here is an example
        : Some example from a text file.

   If the example is source code from a programming language, or any
other text that can be marked up by font-lock in Emacs, you can ask for
the example to look like the fontified Emacs buffer(1).  This is done
with the `src' block, where you also need to specify the name of the
major mode that should be used to fontify the example(2), see *note
Easy Templates:: for shortcuts to easily insert code blocks.  

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (defun org-xor (a b)
          "Exclusive or."
          (if a (not b) b))
     #+END_SRC

   Both in `example' and in `src' snippets, you can add a `-n' switch
to the end of the `BEGIN' line, to get the lines of the example
numbered.  If you use a `+n' switch, the numbering from the previous
numbered snippet will be continued in the current one.  In literal
examples, Org will interpret strings like `(ref:name)' as labels, and
use them as targets for special hyperlinks like `[[(name)]]' (i.e., the
reference name enclosed in single parenthesis).  In HTML, hovering the
mouse over such a link will remote-highlight the corresponding code
line, which is kind of cool.

   You can also add a `-r' switch which removes the labels from the
source code(3).  With the `-n' switch, links to these references will
be labeled by the line numbers from the code listing, otherwise links
will use the labels with no parentheses.  Here is an example:

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n -r
     (save-excursion                  (ref:sc)
        (goto-char (point-min)))      (ref:jump)
     #+END_SRC
     In line [[(sc)]] we remember the current position.  [[(jump)][Line (jump)]]
     jumps to point-min.

   If the syntax for the label format conflicts with the language
syntax, use a `-l' switch to change the format, for example
`#+BEGIN_SRC pascal -n -r -l "((%s))"'.  See also the variable
`org-coderef-label-format'.

   HTML export also allows examples to be published as text areas
(*note Text areas in HTML export::).

   Because the `#+BEGIN_...' and `#+END_...' patterns need to be added
so often, shortcuts are provided using the Easy Templates facility
(*note Easy Templates::).

`C-c ''
     Edit the source code example at point in its native mode.  This
     works by switching to a temporary buffer with the source code.
     You need to exit by pressing `C-c '' again(4).  The edited version
     will then replace the old version in the Org buffer.  Fixed-width
     regions (where each line starts with a colon followed by a space)
     will be edited using `artist-mode'(5) to allow creating ASCII
     drawings easily.  Using this command in an empty line will create
     a new fixed-width region.  

`C-c l'
     Calling `org-store-link' while editing a source code example in a
     temporary buffer created with `C-c '' will prompt for a label.
     Make sure that it is unique in the current buffer, and insert it
     with the proper formatting like `(ref:label)' at the end of the
     current line.  Then the label is stored as a link `(label)', for
     retrieval with `C-c C-l'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This works automatically for the HTML back-end (it requires
version 1.34 of the `htmlize.el' package, which is distributed with
Org).  Fontified code chunks in LaTeX can be achieved using either the
listings or the minted (http://code.google.com/p/minted) package.
Refer to `org-latex-listings' documentation for details.

   (2) Code in `src' blocks may also be evaluated either interactively
or on export.  See *note Working With Source Code:: for more
information on evaluating code blocks.

   (3) Adding `-k' to `-n -r' will keep the labels in the source code
while using line numbers for the links, which might be useful to
explain those in an Org mode example code.

   (4) Upon exit, lines starting with `*', `,*', `#+' and `,#+' will
get a comma prepended, to keep them from being interpreted by Org as
outline nodes or special syntax.  These commas will be stripped for
editing with `C-c '', and also for export.

   (5) You may select a different-mode with the variable
`org-edit-fixed-width-region-mode'.


File: org,  Node: Include files,  Next: Index entries,  Prev: Literal examples,  Up: Markup

11.4 Include files
==================

During export, you can include the content of another file.  For
example, to include your `.emacs' file, you could use: 

     #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" src emacs-lisp

The optional second and third parameter are the markup (e.g., `quote',
`example', or `src'), and, if the markup is `src', the language for
formatting the contents.  The markup is optional; if it is not given,
the text will be assumed to be in Org mode format and will be processed
normally.

   Contents of the included file will belong to the same structure
(headline, item) containing the `INCLUDE' keyword.  In particular,
headlines within the file will become children of the current section.
That behavior can be changed by providing an additional keyword
parameter, `:minlevel'.  In that case, all headlines in the included
file will be shifted so the one with the lowest level reaches that
specified level.  For example, to make a file become a sibling of the
current top-level headline, use

     #+INCLUDE: "~/my-book/chapter2.org" :minlevel 1

   You can also include a portion of a file by specifying a lines range
using the `:lines' parameter.  The line at the upper end of the range
will not be included.  The start and/or the end of the range may be
omitted to use the obvious defaults.

     #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" :lines "5-10"   Include lines 5 to 10, 10 excluded
     #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" :lines "-10"    Include lines 1 to 10, 10 excluded
     #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" :lines "10-"    Include lines from 10 to EOF

`C-c ''

11.5 Index entries
==================

You can specify entries that will be used for generating an index during
publishing.  This is done by lines starting with `#+INDEX'.  An entry
the contains an exclamation mark will create a sub item.  See *note
Generating an index:: for more information.

11.6 Macro replacement
======================

You can define text snippets with

     #+MACRO: name   replacement text $1, $2 are arguments

which can be referenced in paragraphs, verse blocks, table cells and
some keywords with `{{{name(arg1,arg2)}}}'(1).  In addition to defined
macros, `{{{title}}}', `{{{author}}}', etc., will reference information
set by the `#+TITLE:', `#+AUTHOR:', and similar lines.  Also,
`{{{time(FORMAT)}}}' and `{{{modification-time(FORMAT)}}}' refer to
current date time and to the modification time of the file being
exported, respectively.  FORMAT should be a format string understood by
`format-time-string'.

   Macro expansion takes place during export.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Since commas separate arguments, commas within arguments have to
be escaped with a backslash character.  Conversely, backslash
characters before a comma, and only them, need to be escaped with
another backslash character.

11.7 Embedded LaTeX
===================

Plain ASCII is normally sufficient for almost all note taking.
Exceptions include scientific notes, which often require mathematical
symbols and the occasional formula.  LaTeX(1)  is widely used to
typeset scientific documents.  Org mode supports embedding LaTeX code
into its files, because many academics are used to writing and reading
LaTeX source code, and because it can be readily processed to produce
pretty output for a number of export back-ends.

* Menu:

* Special symbols::             Greek letters and other symbols
* Subscripts and superscripts::  Simple syntax for raising/lowering text
* LaTeX fragments::          Complex formulas made easy
* Previewing LaTeX fragments::  What will this snippet look like?
* CDLaTeX mode::                Speed up entering of formulas

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) LaTeX is a macro system based on Donald E. Knuth's TeX system.
Many of the features described here as "LaTeX" are really from TeX, but
for simplicity I am blurring this distinction.


File: org,  Node: Special symbols,  Next: Subscripts and superscripts,  Prev: Embedded LaTeX,  Up: Embedded LaTeX

11.7.1 Special symbols
----------------------

You can use LaTeX-like syntax to insert special symbols like `\alpha'
to indicate the Greek letter, or `\to' to indicate an arrow.  Completion
for these symbols is available, just type `\' and maybe a few letters,
and press `M-<TAB>' to see possible completions.  Unlike LaTeX code,
Org mode allows these symbols to be present without surrounding math
delimiters, for example:

     Angles are written as Greek letters \alpha, \beta and \gamma.

   During export, these symbols will be transformed into the native
format of the exporter back-end.  Strings like `\alpha' will be
exported as `&alpha;' in the HTML output, and as `$\alpha$' in the LaTeX
output.  Similarly, `\nbsp' will become `&nbsp;' in HTML and `~' in
LaTeX.  If you need such a symbol inside a word, terminate it like
this: `\Aacute{}stor'.

   A large number of entities is provided, with names taken from both
HTML and LaTeX; see the variable `org-entities' for the complete list.
`\-' is treated as a shy hyphen, and `--', `---', and `...' are all
converted into special commands creating hyphens of different lengths
or a compact set of dots.

   If you would like to see entities displayed as UTF-8 characters, use
the following command(1):

`C-c C-x \'
     Toggle display of entities as UTF-8 characters.  This does not
     change the buffer content which remains plain ASCII, but it
     overlays the UTF-8 character for display purposes only.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) You can turn this on by default by setting the variable
`org-pretty-entities', or on a per-file base with the `#+STARTUP'
option `entitiespretty'.


File: org,  Node: Subscripts and superscripts,  Next: LaTeX fragments,  Prev: Special symbols,  Up: Embedded LaTeX

11.7.2 Subscripts and superscripts
----------------------------------

Just like in LaTeX, `^' and `_' are used to indicate super- and
subscripts.  Again, these can be used without embedding them in
math-mode delimiters.  To increase the readability of ASCII text, it is
not necessary (but OK) to surround multi-character sub- and
superscripts with curly braces.  For example

     The mass of the sun is M_sun = 1.989 x 10^30 kg.  The radius of
     the sun is R_{sun} = 6.96 x 10^8 m.

   If you write a text where the underscore is often used in a different
context, Org's convention to always interpret these as subscripts can
get in your way.  Configure the variable `org-use-sub-superscripts' to
change this convention.  For example, when setting this variable to
`{}', `a_b' will not be interpreted as a subscript, but `a_{b}' will.

`C-c C-x \'
     In addition to showing entities as UTF-8 characters, this command
     will also format sub- and superscripts in a WYSIWYM way.


File: org,  Node: LaTeX fragments,  Next: Previewing LaTeX fragments,  Prev: Subscripts and superscripts,  Up: Embedded LaTeX

11.7.3 LaTeX fragments
----------------------

Going beyond symbols and sub- and superscripts, a full formula language
is needed.  Org mode can contain LaTeX math fragments, and it supports
ways to process these for several export back-ends.  When exporting to
LaTeX, the code is obviously left as it is.  When exporting to HTML,
Org invokes the MathJax library (http://www.mathjax.org) (*note Math
formatting in HTML export::) to process and display the math(1).
Finally, it can also process the mathematical expressions into
images(2) that can be displayed in a browser.

   LaTeX fragments don't need any special marking at all.  The following
snippets will be identified as LaTeX source code:
   * Environments of any kind(3).  The only requirement is that the
     `\begin' and `\end' statements appear on a new line, at the
     beginning of the line or after whitespaces only.

   * Text within the usual LaTeX math delimiters.  To avoid conflicts
     with currency specifications, single `$' characters are only
     recognized as math delimiters if the enclosed text contains at
     most two line breaks, is directly attached to the `$' characters
     with no whitespace in between, and if the closing `$' is followed
     by whitespace, punctuation or a dash.  For the other delimiters,
     there is no such restriction, so when in doubt, use `\(...\)' as
     inline math delimiters.

For example:

     \begin{equation}
     x=\sqrt{b}
     \end{equation}

     If $a^2=b$ and \( b=2 \), then the solution must be
     either $$ a=+\sqrt{2} $$ or \[ a=-\sqrt{2} \].

   LaTeX processing can be configured with the variable
`org-export-with-latex'.  The default setting is `t' which means
`MathJax' for HTML, and no processing for ASCII and LaTeX back-ends.
You can also set this variable on a per-file basis using one of these
lines:

     #+OPTIONS: tex:t          Do the right thing automatically (MathJax)
     #+OPTIONS: tex:nil        Do not process LaTeX fragments at all
     #+OPTIONS: tex:verbatim   Verbatim export, for jsMath or so

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If you plan to use this regularly or on pages with significant
page views, you should install `MathJax' on your own server in order to
limit the load of our server.

   (2) For this to work you need to be on a system with a working LaTeX
installation.  You also need the `dvipng' program or the `convert',
respectively available at `http://sourceforge.net/projects/dvipng/' and
from the `imagemagick' suite.  The LaTeX header that will be used when
processing a fragment can be configured with the variable
`org-format-latex-header'.

   (3) When `MathJax' is used, only the environments recognized by
`MathJax' will be processed.  When `dvipng' program or `imagemagick'
suite is used to create images, any LaTeX environment will be handled.


File: org,  Node: Previewing LaTeX fragments,  Next: CDLaTeX mode,  Prev: LaTeX fragments,  Up: Embedded LaTeX

11.7.4 Previewing LaTeX fragments
---------------------------------

If you have `dvipng' or `imagemagick' installed(1), LaTeX fragments can
be processed to produce preview images of the typeset expressions:

`C-c C-x C-l'
     Produce a preview image of the LaTeX fragment at point and overlay
     it over the source code.  If there is no fragment at point,
     process all fragments in the current entry (between two
     headlines).  When called with a prefix argument, process the
     entire subtree.  When called with two prefix arguments, or when
     the cursor is before the first headline, process the entire buffer.  

`C-c C-c'
     Remove the overlay preview images.

   You can customize the variable `org-format-latex-options' to
influence some aspects of the preview.  In particular, the `:scale'
(and for HTML export, `:html-scale') property can be used to adjust the
size of the preview images.

   You can turn on the previewing of all LaTeX fragments in a file with

     #+STARTUP: latexpreview

   To disable it, simply use

     #+STARTUP: nolatexpreview

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Choose the converter by setting the variable
`org-latex-create-formula-image-program' accordingly.


File: org,  Node: CDLaTeX mode,  Prev: Previewing LaTeX fragments,  Up: Embedded LaTeX

11.7.5 Using CDLaTeX to enter math
----------------------------------

CDLaTeX mode is a minor mode that is normally used in combination with a
major LaTeX mode like AUCTeX in order to speed-up insertion of
environments and math templates.  Inside Org mode, you can make use of
some of the features of CDLaTeX mode.  You need to install `cdlatex.el'
and `texmathp.el' (the latter comes also with AUCTeX) from
`http://www.astro.uva.nl/~dominik/Tools/cdlatex'.  Don't use CDLaTeX
mode itself under Org mode, but use the light version
`org-cdlatex-mode' that comes as part of Org mode.  Turn it on for the
current buffer with `M-x org-cdlatex-mode RET', or for all Org files
with

     (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-org-cdlatex)

   When this mode is enabled, the following features are present (for
more details see the documentation of CDLaTeX mode):
   * Environment templates can be inserted with `C-c {'.

   * The <TAB> key will do template expansion if the cursor is inside a
     LaTeX fragment(1).  For example, <TAB> will expand `fr' to
     `\frac{}{}' and position the cursor correctly inside the first
     brace.  Another <TAB> will get you into the second brace.  Even
     outside fragments, <TAB> will expand environment abbreviations at
     the beginning of a line.  For example, if you write `equ' at the
     beginning of a line and press <TAB>, this abbreviation will be
     expanded to an `equation' environment.  To get a list of all
     abbreviations, type `M-x cdlatex-command-help RET'.

   * Pressing `_' and `^' inside a LaTeX fragment will insert these
     characters together with a pair of braces.  If you use <TAB> to
     move out of the braces, and if the braces surround only a single
     character or macro, they are removed again (depending on the
     variable `cdlatex-simplify-sub-super-scripts').

   * Pressing the backquote ``' followed by a character inserts math
     macros, also outside LaTeX fragments.  If you wait more than 1.5
     seconds after the backquote, a help window will pop up.

   * Pressing the single-quote `'' followed by another character
     modifies the symbol before point with an accent or a font.  If you
     wait more than 1.5 seconds after the single-quote, a help window
     will pop up.  Character modification will work only inside LaTeX
     fragments; outside the quote is normal.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Org mode has a method to test if the cursor is inside such a
fragment, see the documentation of the function
`org-inside-LaTeX-fragment-p'.


File: org,  Node: Special blocks,  Prev: Embedded LaTeX,  Up: Markup

11.8 Special blocks
===================

Org syntax includes pre-defined blocks (*note Paragraphs:: and *note
Literal examples::).  It is also possible to create blocks containing
raw code targeted at a specific back-ends (e.g., `#+BEGIN_LATEX').

   Any other block is a _special block_.

   For example, `#+BEGIN_ABSTRACT' and `#+BEGIN_VIDEO' are special
blocks.  The first one is useful when exporting to LaTeX, the second one
when exporting to HTML5.

   Each export back-end decides if they should be exported, and how.
When the block is ignored, its contents are still exported, as if the
opening and closing block lines were not there.  For example, when
exporting a `#+BEGIN_TEST' block, HTML back-end wraps its contents
within a `<div name="test">' tag.

   Refer to back-end specific documentation for more information.

12 Exporting
************

The Org mode export facilities can be used to export Org documents or
parts of Org documents to a variety of other formats.  In addition,
these facilities can be used with `orgtbl-mode' and/or `orgstruct-mode'
in foreign buffers so you can author tables and lists in Org syntax and
convert them in place to the target language.

   ASCII export produces a readable and simple version of an Org file
for printing and sharing notes.  HTML export allows you to easily
publish notes on the web, or to build full-fledged websites.  LaTeX
export lets you use Org mode and its structured editing functions to
create arbitrarily complex LaTeX files for any kind of document.
OpenDocument Text (ODT) export allows seamless collaboration across
organizational boundaries.  Markdown export lets you seamlessly
collaborate with other developers.  Finally, iCal export can extract
entries with deadlines or appointments to produce a file in the
iCalendar format.

File: org,  Node: The Export Dispatcher,  Next: Export back-ends,  Prev: Exporting,  Up: Exporting

12.1 The Export Dispatcher
==========================

The main entry point for export related tasks is the dispatcher, a
hierarchical menu from which it is possible to select an export format
and toggle export options(1) from which it is possible to select an
export format and to toggle export options.

`C-c C-e'     (`org-export-dispatch')
     Dispatch for export and publishing commands.  When called with a
     `C-u' prefix argument, repeat the last export command on the
     current buffer while preserving toggled options.  If the current
     buffer hasn't changed and subtree export was activated, the
     command will affect that same subtree.

   Normally the entire buffer is exported, but if there is an active
region only that part of the buffer will be exported.

   Several export options (*note Export settings::) can be toggled from
the export dispatcher with the following key combinations:

`C-a'
     Toggle asynchronous export.  Asynchronous export uses an external
     Emacs process that is configured with a specified initialization
     file.

     While exporting asynchronously, the output is not displayed.  It
     is stored in a list called "the export stack", and can be viewed
     from there.  The stack can be reached by calling the dispatcher
     with a double `C-u' prefix argument, or with `&' key from the
     dispatcher.

     To make this behavior the default, customize the variable
     `org-export-in-background'.

`C-b'
     Toggle body-only export.  Its effect depends on the back-end used.
     Typically, if the back-end has a header section (like
     `<head>...</head>' in the HTML back-end), a body-only export will
     not include this header.

`C-s'
     Toggle subtree export.  The top heading becomes the document title.

     You can change the default state of this option by setting
     `org-export-initial-scope'.

`C-v'
     Toggle visible-only export.  Only export the text that is currently
     visible, i.e. not hidden by outline visibility in the buffer.


   With the exception of asynchronous export, a successful export
process writes its output to the kill-ring. You can configure this
behavior by altering the option `org-export-copy-to-kill-ring'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) It is also possible to use a less intrusive interface by setting
`org-export-dispatch-use-expert-ui' to a non-`nil' value.  In that
case, only a prompt is visible from the minibuffer.  From there one can
still switch back to regular menu by pressing <?>.

12.2 Export back-ends
=====================

An export back-end is a library that translates Org syntax into a
foreign format.  An export format is not available until the proper
back-end has been loaded.

   By default, the following four back-ends are loaded: `ascii',
`html', `icalendar' and `latex'.  It is possible to add more (or remove
some) by customizing `org-export-backends'.

   Built-in back-ends include:

   * ascii (ASCII format)

   * beamer (LaTeX Beamer format)

   * html (HTML format)

   * icalendar (iCalendar format)

   * latex (LaTeX format)

   * man (Man page format)

   * md (Markdown format)

   * odt (OpenDocument Text format)

   * org (Org format)

   * texinfo (Texinfo format)

   Other back-ends might be found in the `contrib/' directory (*note
Installation::).


File: org,  Node: Export settings,  Next: ASCII/Latin-1/UTF-8 export,  Prev: Export back-ends,  Up: Exporting

12.3 Export settings
====================

Export options can be set: globally with variables; for an individual
file by making variables buffer-local with in-buffer settings (*note
In-buffer settings::), by setting individual keywords, or by specifying
them in a compact form with the `#+OPTIONS' keyword; or for a tree by
setting properties (*note Properties and Columns::).  Options set at a
specific level override options set at a more general level.

   In-buffer settings may appear anywhere in the file, either directly
or indirectly through a file included using `#+SETUPFILE: filename'
syntax.  Option keyword sets tailored to a particular back-end can be
inserted from the export dispatcher (*note The Export Dispatcher::)
using the `Insert template' command by pressing <#>.  To insert
keywords individually, a good way to make sure the keyword is correct
is to type `#+' and then to use `M-<TAB>' for completion.

   The export keywords available for every back-end, and their
equivalent global variables, include:

`AUTHOR'
     The document author (`user-full-name').

`CREATOR'
     Entity responsible for output generation
     (`org-export-creator-string').

`DATE'
     A date or a time-stamp(1).

`DESCRIPTION'
     The document description.  Back-ends handle it as they see fit
     (e.g., for the XHTML meta tag), if at all.  You can use several
     such keywords for long descriptions.

`EMAIL'
     The email address (`user-mail-address').

`KEYWORDS'
     The keywords defining the contents of the document.  Back-ends
     handle it as they see fit (e.g., for the XHTML meta tag), if at
     all.  You can use several such keywords if the list is long.

`LANGUAGE'
     The language used for translating some strings
     (`org-export-default-language').  E.g., `#+LANGUAGE: fr' will tell
     Org to translate _File_ (english) into _Fichier_ (french) in the
     clocktable.

`SELECT_TAGS'
     The tags that select a tree for export (`org-export-select-tags').
     The default value is `:export:'.  Within a subtree tagged with
     `:export:', you can still exclude entries with `:noexport:' (see
     below).  When headlines are selectively exported with `:export:'
     anywhere in a file, text before the first headline is ignored.

`EXCLUDE_TAGS'
     The tags that exclude a tree from export
     (`org-export-exclude-tags').  The default value is `:noexport:'.
     Entries with the `:noexport:' tag will be unconditionally excluded
     from the export, even if they have an `:export:' tag.

`TITLE'
     The title to be shown (otherwise derived from buffer's name).  You
     can use several such keywords for long titles.

   The `#+OPTIONS' keyword is a compact(2) form that recognizes the
following arguments:

`':'
     Toggle smart quotes (`org-export-with-smart-quotes').

`*:'
     Toggle emphasized text (`org-export-with-emphasize').

`-:'
     Toggle conversion of special strings
     (`org-export-with-special-strings').

`::'
     Toggle fixed-width sections (`org-export-with-fixed-width').

`<:'
     Toggle inclusion of any time/date active/inactive stamps
     (`org-export-with-timestamps').

`:'
     Toggle line-break-preservation (`org-export-preserve-breaks').

`^:'
     Toggle TeX-like syntax for sub- and superscripts.  If you write
     "^:{}", `a_{b}' will be interpreted, but the simple `a_b' will be
     left as it is (`org-export-with-sub-superscripts').

`arch:'
     Configure export of archived trees.  Can be set to `headline' to
     only process the headline, skipping its contents
     (`org-export-with-archived-trees').

`author:'
     Toggle inclusion of author name into exported file
     (`org-export-with-author').

`c:'
     Toggle inclusion of CLOCK keywords (`org-export-with-clocks').

`creator:'
     Configure inclusion of creator info into exported file.  It may be
     set to `comment' (`org-export-with-creator').

`d:'
     Toggle inclusion of drawers, or list drawers to include
     (`org-export-with-drawers').

`e:'
     Toggle inclusion of entities (`org-export-with-entities').

`email:'
     Toggle inclusion of the author's e-mail into exported file
     (`org-export-with-email').

`f:'
     Toggle the inclusion of footnotes (`org-export-with-footnotes').

`H:'
     Set the number of headline levels for export
     (`org-export-headline-levels').  Below that level, headlines are
     treated differently.  In most back-ends, they become list items.

`inline:'
     Toggle inclusion of inlinetasks (`org-export-with-inlinetasks').

`num:'
     Toggle section-numbers (`org-export-with-section-numbers').  It
     can also be set to a number `n', so only headlines at that level
     or above will be numbered.

`p:'
     Toggle export of planning information (`org-export-with-planning').
     "Planning information" is the line containing the `SCHEDULED:', the
     `DEADLINE:' or the `CLOSED:' cookies or a combination of them.

`pri:'
     Toggle inclusion of priority cookies (`org-export-with-priority').

`stat:'
     Toggle inclusion of statistics cookies
     (`org-export-with-statistics-cookies').

`tags:'
     Toggle inclusion of tags, may also be `not-in-toc'
     (`org-export-with-tags').

`tasks:'
     Toggle inclusion of tasks (TODO items), can be `nil' to remove all
     tasks, `todo' to remove DONE tasks, or a list of keywords to keep
     (`org-export-with-tasks').

`tex:'
     Configure export of LaTeX fragments and environments.  It may be
     set to `verbatim' (`org-export-with-latex').

`timestamp:'
     Toggle inclusion of the creation time into exported file
     (`org-export-time-stamp-file').

`toc:'
     Toggle inclusion of the table of contents, or set the level limit
     (`org-export-with-toc').

`todo:'
     Toggle inclusion of TODO keywords into exported text
     (`org-export-with-todo-keywords').

`|:'
     Toggle inclusion of tables (`org-export-with-tables').

   When exporting only a subtree, each of the previous keywords(3) can
be overridden locally by special node properties.  These begin with
`EXPORT_', followed by the name of the keyword they supplant.  For
example, `DATE' and `OPTIONS' keywords become, respectively,
`EXPORT_DATE' and `EXPORT_OPTIONS' properties.  Subtree export also
supports the self-explicit `EXPORT_FILE_NAME' property(4).

   If `org-export-allow-bind-keywords' is non-`nil', Emacs variables
can become buffer-local during export by using the BIND keyword.  Its
syntax is `#+BIND: variable value'.  This is particularly useful for
in-buffer settings that cannot be changed using specific keywords.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The variable `org-export-date-timestamp-format' defines how this
time-stamp will be exported.

   (2) If you want to configure many options this way, you can use
several `#+OPTIONS' lines.

   (3) With the exception of `SETUPFILE'.

   (4) There is no buffer-wide equivalent for this property.  The file
name in this case is derived from the file associated to the buffer, if
possible, or asked to the user otherwise.

12.4 ASCII/Latin-1/UTF-8 export
===============================

ASCII export produces a simple and very readable version of an Org mode
file, containing only plain ASCII.  Latin-1 and UTF-8 export augment
the file with special characters and symbols available in these
encodings.

   Links are exported in a footnote-like style, with the descriptive
part in the text and the link in a note before the next heading.  See
the variable `org-ascii-links-to-notes' for details and other options.

ASCII export commands
---------------------

`C-c C-e t a/l/u     (`org-ascii-export-to-ascii')'
     Export as an ASCII file.  For an Org file, `myfile.org', the ASCII
     file will be `myfile.txt'.  The file will be overwritten without
     warning.  When the original file is `myfile.txt', the resulting
     file becomes `myfile.txt.txt' in order to prevent data loss.  

`C-c C-e t A/L/U     (`org-ascii-export-as-ascii')'
     Export to a temporary buffer.  Do not create a file.

Header and sectioning structure
-------------------------------

In the exported version, the first three outline levels become
headlines, defining a general document structure.  Additional levels
are exported as lists.  The transition can also occur at a different
level (*note Export settings::).

Quoting ASCII text
------------------

You can insert text that will only appear when using `ASCII' back-end
with the following constructs:

     Text @@ascii:and additional text@@ within a paragraph.

     #+ASCII: Some text

     #+BEGIN_ASCII
     All lines in this block will appear only when using this back-end.
     #+END_ASCII

ASCII specific attributes
-------------------------

`ASCII' back-end only understands one attribute, `:width', which
specifies the length, in characters, of a given horizontal rule.  It
must be specified using an `ATTR_ASCII' line, directly preceding the
rule.

     #+ATTR_ASCII: :width 10

12.5 Beamer export
==================

The LaTeX class _Beamer_ allows production of high quality
presentations using LaTeX and pdf processing.  Org mode has special
support for turning an Org mode file or tree into a Beamer presentation.

Beamer export commands
----------------------

`C-c C-e l b     (`org-beamer-export-to-latex')'
     Export as a LaTeX file.  For an Org file `myfile.org', the LaTeX
     file will be `myfile.tex'.  The file will be overwritten without
     warning.  

`C-c C-e l B     (`org-beamer-export-as-latex')'
     Export to a temporary buffer.  Do not create a file.  

`C-c C-e l P     (`org-beamer-export-to-pdf')'
     Export as LaTeX and then process to PDF.

`C-c C-e l O'
     Export as LaTeX and then process to PDF, then open the resulting
     PDF file.

Sectioning, Frames and Blocks
-----------------------------

Any tree with not-too-deep level nesting should in principle be
exportable as a Beamer presentation.  Headlines fall into three
categories: sectioning elements, frames and blocks.

   - Headlines become frames when their level is equal to
     `org-beamer-frame-level' or `H' value in an `OPTIONS' line (*note
     Export settings::).

     Though, if a headline in the current tree has a `BEAMER_ENV'
     property set to either to `frame' or `fullframe', its level
     overrides the variable.  A `fullframe' is a frame with an empty
     (ignored) title.

   - All frame's children become `block' environments.  Special block
     types can be enforced by setting headline's `BEAMER_ENV'
     property(1) to an appropriate value (see
     `org-beamer-environments-default' for supported values and
     `org-beamer-environments-extra' for adding more).

   - As a special case, if the `BEAMER_ENV' property is set to either
     `appendix', `note', `noteNH' or `againframe', the headline will
     become, respectively, an appendix, a note (within frame or between
     frame, depending on its level), a note with its title ignored or an
     `\againframe' command.  In the latter case, a `BEAMER_REF' property
     is mandatory in order to refer to the frame being resumed, and
     contents are ignored.

     Also, a headline with an `ignoreheading' environment will have its
     contents only inserted in the output.  This special value is
     useful to have data between frames, or to properly close a
     `column' environment.

   Headlines also support `BEAMER_ACT' and `BEAMER_OPT' properties.
The former is translated as an overlay/action specification, or a
default overlay specification when enclosed within square brackets.
The latter specifies options(2) for the current frame or block.  The
export back-end will automatically wrap properties within angular or
square brackets when appropriate.

   Moreover, headlines handle the `BEAMER_COL' property.  Its value
should be a decimal number representing the width of the column as a
fraction of the total text width.  If the headline has no specific
environment, its title will be ignored and its contents will fill the
column created.  Otherwise, the block will fill the whole column and
the title will be preserved.  Two contiguous headlines with a non-`nil'
`BEAMER_COL' value share the same `columns' LaTeX environment.  It will
end before the next headline without such a property.  This environment
is generated automatically.  Although, it can also be explicitly
created, with a special `columns' value for `BEAMER_ENV' property (if
it needs to be set up with some specific options, for example).

Beamer specific syntax
----------------------

Beamer back-end is an extension of LaTeX back-end.  As such, all LaTeX
specific syntax (e.g., `#+LATEX:' or `#+ATTR_LATEX:') is recognized.
See *note LaTeX and PDF export:: for more information.

   Beamer export introduces a number of keywords to insert code in the
document's header.  Four control appearance of the presentation:
`#+BEAMER_THEME', `#+BEAMER_COLOR_THEME', `#+BEAMER_FONT_THEME',
`#+BEAMER_INNER_THEME' and `#+BEAMER_OUTER_THEME'.  All of them accept
optional arguments within square brackets.  The last one,
`#+BEAMER_HEADER', is more generic and allows you to append any line of
code in the header.

     #+BEAMER_THEME: Rochester [height=20pt]
     #+BEAMER_COLOR_THEME: spruce

   Table of contents generated from `toc:t' `OPTION' keyword are
wrapped within a `frame' environment.  Those generated from a `TOC'
keyword (*note Table of contents::) are not.  In that case, it is also
possible to specify options, enclosed within square brackets.

     #+TOC: headlines [currentsection]

   Beamer specific code can be inserted with the following constructs:

     #+BEAMER: \pause

     #+BEGIN_BEAMER
     All lines in this block will appear only when using this back-end.
     #+END_BEAMER

     Text @@beamer:some code@@ within a paragraph.

   In particular, this last example can be used to add overlay
specifications to objects whose type is among `bold', `item', `link',
`radio-target' and `target', when the value is enclosed within angular
brackets and put at the beginning the object.

     A *@@beamer:<2->@@useful* feature

   Eventually, every plain list has support for `:environment',
`:overlay' and `:options' attributes through `ATTR_BEAMER' affiliated
keyword.  The first one allows the use of a different environment, the
second sets overlay specifications and the last one inserts optional
arguments in current list environment.

     #+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay +-
     - item 1
     - item 2

Editing support
---------------

You can turn on a special minor mode `org-beamer-mode' for faster
editing with:

     #+STARTUP: beamer

`C-c C-b     (`org-beamer-select-environment')'
     In `org-beamer-mode', this key offers fast selection of a Beamer
     environment or the `BEAMER_COL' property.

   Also, a template for useful in-buffer settings or properties can be
inserted into the buffer with `M-x org-beamer-insert-options-template'.
Among other things, this will install a column view format which is
very handy for editing special properties used by Beamer.

An example
----------

Here is a simple example Org document that is intended for Beamer
export.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If this property is set, the entry will also get a
`:B_environment:' tag to make this visible.  This tag has no semantic
meaning, it is only a visual aid.

   (2) The `fragile' option is added automatically if it contains code
that requires a verbatim environment, though.

File: org,  Node: HTML doctypes,  Next: HTML preamble and postamble,  Prev: HTML Export commands,  Up: HTML export

12.6.2 HTML doctypes
--------------------

Org can export to various (X)HTML flavors.

   Setting the variable `org-html-doctype' allows you to export to
different (X)HTML variants.  The exported HTML will be adjusted
according to the syntax requirements of that variant.  You can either
set this variable to a doctype string directly, in which case the
exporter will try to adjust the syntax automatically, or you can use a
ready-made doctype.  The ready-made options are:

   * "html4-strict"

   * "html4-transitional"

   * "html4-frameset"

   * "xhtml-strict"

   * "xhtml-transitional"

   * "xhtml-frameset"

   * "xhtml-11"

   * "html5"

   * "xhtml5"

   See the variable `org-html-doctype-alist' for details.  The default
is "xhtml-strict".

Fancy HTML5 export
..................

HTML5 introduces several new element types.  By default, Org will not
make use of these element types, but you can set `org-html-html5-fancy'
to `t' (or set `html5-fancy' item in an `OPTIONS' line), to enable a
few new block-level elements.  These are created using arbitrary
#+BEGIN and #+END blocks. For instance:

     #+BEGIN_ASIDE
     Lorem ipsum
     #+END_ASIDE

   Will export to:

     <aside>
       <p>Lorem ipsum</p>
     </aside>

   While this:

     #+ATTR_HTML: :controls controls :width 350
     #+BEGIN_VIDEO
     #+HTML: <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
     #+HTML: <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
     Your browser does not support the video tag.
     #+END_VIDEO

   Becomes:

     <video controls="controls" width="350">
       <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
       <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
       <p>Your browser does not support the video tag.</p>
     </video>

   Special blocks that do not correspond to HTML5 elements (see
`org-html-html5-elements') will revert to the usual behavior, i.e.,
`#+BEGIN_LEDERHOSEN' will still export to `<div class="lederhosen">'.

   Headlines cannot appear within special blocks.  To wrap a headline
and its contents in e.g., `<section>' or `<article>' tags, set the
`HTML_CONTAINER' property on the headline itself.


File: org,  Node: HTML preamble and postamble,  Next: Quoting HTML tags,  Prev: HTML doctypes,  Up: HTML export

12.6.3 HTML preamble and postamble
----------------------------------

The HTML exporter lets you define a preamble and a postamble.

   The default value for `org-html-preamble' is `t', which means that
the preamble is inserted depending on the relevant format string in
`org-html-preamble-format'.

   Setting `org-html-preamble' to a string will override the default
format string.  If you set it to a function, it will insert the output
of the function, which must be a string.  Setting to `nil' will not
insert any preamble.

   The default value for `org-html-postamble' is `'auto', which means
that the HTML exporter will look for information about the author, the
email, the creator and the date, and build the postamble from these
values.  Setting `org-html-postamble' to `t' will insert the postamble
from the relevant format string found in `org-html-postamble-format'.
Setting it to `nil' will not insert any postamble.

12.6.4 Quoting HTML tags
------------------------

Plain `<' and `>' are always transformed to `&lt;' and `&gt;' in HTML
export.  If you want to include raw HTML code, which should only appear
in HTML export, mark it with `@@html:' as in `@@html:<b>@@bold
text@@html:</b>@@'.  For more extensive HTML that should be copied
verbatim to the exported file use either

     #+HTML: Literal HTML code for export

or 

     #+BEGIN_HTML
     All lines between these markers are exported literally
     #+END_HTML


File: org,  Node: Links in HTML export,  Next: Tables in HTML export,  Prev: Quoting HTML tags,  Up: HTML export

12.6.5 Links in HTML export
---------------------------

Internal links (*note Internal links::) will continue to work in HTML.
This includes automatic links created by radio targets (*note Radio
targets::).  Links to external files will still work if the target file
is on the same relative path as the published Org file.  Links to other
`.org' files will be translated into HTML links under the assumption
that an HTML version also exists of the linked file, at the same
relative path.  `id:' links can then be used to jump to specific
entries across files.  For information related to linking files while
publishing them to a publishing directory see *note Publishing links::.

   If you want to specify attributes for links, you can do so using a
special `#+ATTR_HTML' line to define attributes that will be added to
the `<a>' or `<img>' tags.  Here is an example that sets `title' and
`style' attributes for a link:

     #+ATTR_HTML: :title The Org mode homepage :style color:red;
     [[http://orgmode.org]]


File: org,  Node: Tables in HTML export,  Next: Images in HTML export,  Prev: Links in HTML export,  Up: HTML export

12.6.6 Tables
-------------

Org mode tables are exported to HTML using the table attributes defined
in `org-html-table-default-attributes'.  The default setting makes
tables without cell borders and frame.  If you would like to change
this for individual tables, place something like the following before
the table:

     #+CAPTION: This is a table with lines around and between cells
     #+ATTR_HTML: :border 2 :rules all :frame border

   You can also modify the default tags used for each row by setting
`org-html-table-row-tags'.  See the docstring for an example on how to
use this option.


File: org,  Node: Images in HTML export,  Next: Math formatting in HTML export,  Prev: Tables in HTML export,  Up: HTML export

12.6.7 Images in HTML export
----------------------------

HTML export can inline images given as links in the Org file, and it
can make an image the clickable part of a link.  By default(1), images
are inlined if a link does not have a description.  So
`[[file:myimg.jpg]]' will be inlined, while `[[file:myimg.jpg][the
image]]' will just produce a link `the image' that points to the image.
If the description part itself is a `file:' link or a `http:' URL
pointing to an image, this image will be inlined and activated so that
clicking on the image will activate the link.  For example, to include
a thumbnail that will link to a high resolution version of the image,
you could use:

     [[file:highres.jpg][file:thumb.jpg]]

   If you need to add attributes to an inlined image, use a
`#+ATTR_HTML'.  In the example below we specify the `alt' and `title'
attributes to support text viewers and accessibility, and align it to
the right.

     #+CAPTION: A black cat stalking a spider
     #+ATTR_HTML: :alt cat/spider image :title Action! :align right
     [[./img/a.jpg]]

You could use `http' addresses just as well.

File: org,  Node: Math formatting in HTML export,  Next: Text areas in HTML export,  Prev: Images in HTML export,  Up: HTML export

12.6.8 Math formatting in HTML export
-------------------------------------

LaTeX math snippets (*note LaTeX fragments::) can be displayed in two
different ways on HTML pages.  The default is to use the MathJax system
(http://www.mathjax.org) which should work out of the box with Org mode
installation because `http://orgmode.org' serves `MathJax' for Org mode
users for small applications and for testing purposes.  If you plan to
use this regularly or on pages with significant page views, you should
install(1) MathJax on your own server in order to limit the load of our
server.  To configure `MathJax', use the variable
`org-html-mathjax-options' or insert something like the following into
the buffer:

     #+HTML_MATHJAX: align:"left" mathml:t path:"/MathJax/MathJax.js"

See the docstring of the variable `org-html-mathjax-options' for the
meaning of the parameters in this line.

   If you prefer, you can also request that LaTeX fragments are
processed into small images that will be inserted into the browser
page.  Before the availability of MathJax, this was the default method
for Org files.  This method requires that the `dvipng' program or
`imagemagick' suite is available on your system.  You can still get
this processing with

     #+OPTIONS: tex:dvipng

   or:

     #+OPTIONS: tex:imagemagick

An alternative way to publish literal code examples in HTML is to use
text areas, where the example can even be edited before pasting it into
an application.  It is triggered by `:textarea' attribute at an
`example' or `src' block.

   You may also use `:height' and `:width' attributes to specify the
height and width of the text area, which default to the number of lines
in the example, and 80, respectively.  For example

     #+ATTR_HTML: :textarea t :width 40
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       (defun org-xor (a b)
          "Exclusive or."
          (if a (not b) b))
     #+END_EXAMPLE

12.6.10 CSS support
-------------------

You can modify the CSS style definitions for the exported file.  The
HTML exporter assigns the following special CSS classes(1) to
appropriate parts of the document--your style specifications may change
these, in addition to any of the standard classes like for headlines,
tables, etc.
     p.author            author information, including email
     p.date              publishing date
     p.creator           creator info, about org mode version
     .title              document title
     .todo               TODO keywords, all not-done states
     .done               the DONE keywords, all states that count as done
     .WAITING            each TODO keyword also uses a class named after itself
     .timestamp          timestamp
     .timestamp-kwd      keyword associated with a timestamp, like SCHEDULED
     .timestamp-wrapper  span around keyword plus timestamp
     .tag                tag in a headline
     ._HOME              each tag uses itself as a class, "@" replaced by "_"
     .target             target for links
     .linenr             the line number in a code example
     .code-highlighted   for highlighting referenced code lines
     div.outline-N       div for outline level N (headline plus text))
     div.outline-text-N  extra div for text at outline level N
     .section-number-N   section number in headlines, different for each level
     .figure-number      label like "Figure 1:"
     .table-number       label like "Table 1:"
     .listing-number     label like "Listing 1:"
     div.figure          how to format an inlined image
     pre.src             formatted source code
     pre.example         normal example
     p.verse             verse paragraph
     div.footnotes       footnote section headline
     p.footnote          footnote definition paragraph, containing a footnote
     .footref            a footnote reference number (always a <sup>)
     .footnum            footnote number in footnote definition (always <sup>)

   Each exported file contains a compact default style that defines
these classes in a basic way(2).  You may overwrite these settings, or
add to them by using the variables `org-html-head' and
`org-html-head-extra'.  You can override the global values of these
variables for each file by using these keywords:

     #+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style1.css" />
     #+HTML_HEAD_EXTRA: <link rel="alternate stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style2.css" />

For longer style definitions, you can use several such lines.  You
could also directly write a `<style>' `</style>' section in this way,
without referring to an external file.

   In order to add styles to a subtree, use the `:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS:'
property to assign a class to the tree.  In order to specify CSS styles
for a particular headline, you can use the id specified in a
`:CUSTOM_ID:' property.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If the classes on TODO keywords and tags lead to conflicts, use
the variables `org-html-todo-kwd-class-prefix' and
`org-html-tag-class-prefix' to make them unique.

   (2) This style is defined in the constant `org-html-style-default',
which you should not modify.  To turn inclusion of these defaults off,
customize `org-html-head-include-default-style' or set `html-style' to
`nil' in an `OPTIONS' line.

12.6.11 JavaScript supported display of web pages
-------------------------------------------------

Sebastian Rose has written a JavaScript program especially designed to
enhance the web viewing experience of HTML files created with Org.  This
program allows you to view large files in two different ways.  The
first one is an _Info_-like mode where each section is displayed
separately and navigation can be done with the `n' and `p' keys (and
some other keys as well, press `?' for an overview of the available
keys).  The second view type is a _folding_ view much like Org provides
inside Emacs.  The script is available at
`http://orgmode.org/org-info.js' and you can find the documentation for
it at `http://orgmode.org/worg/code/org-info-js/'.  We host the script
at our site, but if you use it a lot, you might not want to be
dependent on `http://orgmode.org' and prefer to install a local copy on
your own web server.

   All it then takes to use this program is adding a single line to the
Org file:

     #+INFOJS_OPT: view:info toc:nil

If this line is found, the HTML header will automatically contain the
code needed to invoke the script.  Using the line above, you can set
the following viewing options:

     path:    The path to the script.  The default is to grab the script from
              `http://orgmode.org/org-info.js', but you might want to have
              a local copy and use a path like `../scripts/org-info.js'.
     view:    Initial view when the website is first shown.  Possible values are:
              info      Info-like interface with one section per page.
              overview  Folding interface, initially showing only top-level.
              content   Folding interface, starting with all headlines visible.
              showall   Folding interface, all headlines and text visible.
     sdepth:  Maximum headline level that will still become an independent
              section for info and folding modes.  The default is taken from
              `org-export-headline-levels' (= the `H' switch in `#+OPTIONS').
              If this is smaller than in `org-export-headline-levels', each
              info/folding section can still contain child headlines.
     toc:     Should the table of contents _initially_ be visible?
              Even when `nil', you can always get to the "toc" with `i'.
     tdepth:  The depth of the table of contents.  The defaults are taken from
              the variables `org-export-headline-levels' and `org-export-with-toc'.
     ftoc:    Does the CSS of the page specify a fixed position for the "toc"?
              If yes, the toc will never be displayed as a section.
     ltoc:    Should there be short contents (children) in each section?
              Make this `above' if the section should be above initial text.
     mouse:   Headings are highlighted when the mouse is over them.  Should be
              `underline' (default) or a background color like `#cccccc'.
     buttons: Should view-toggle buttons be everywhere?  When `nil' (the
              default), only one such button will be present.
   You can choose default values for these options by customizing the
variable `org-html-infojs-options'.  If you always want to apply the
script to your pages, configure the variable `org-html-use-infojs'.

12.7 LaTeX and PDF export
=========================

LaTeX export can produce an arbitrarily complex LaTeX document of any
standard or custom document class.  With further processing(1), which
the LaTeX exporter is able to control, this back-end is able to produce
PDF output.  Because the LaTeX exporter can be configured to use the
`hyperref' package, the default setup produces fully-linked PDF output.

   As in LaTeX, blank lines are meaningful for this back-end: a
paragraph will not be started if two contiguous syntactical elements
are not separated by an empty line.

   This back-end also offers enhanced support for footnotes.  Thus, it
handles nested footnotes, footnotes in tables and footnotes in a list
item's description.

* Header and sectioning::       Setting up the export file structure
* Quoting LaTeX code::       Incorporating literal LaTeX code
* LaTeX specific attributes::  Controlling LaTeX output

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The default LaTeX output is designed for processing with
`pdftex' or LaTeX.  It includes packages that are not compatible with
`xetex' and possibly `luatex'.  The LaTeX exporter can be configured to
support alternative TeX engines, see the options
`org-latex-default-packages-alist' and `org-latex-packages-alist'.

12.7.1 LaTeX export commands
----------------------------

`C-c C-e l l     (`org-latex-export-to-latex')'
     Export as a LaTeX file.  For an Org file `myfile.org', the LaTeX
     file will be `myfile.tex'.  The file will be overwritten without
     warning.  

`C-c C-e l L     (`org-latex-export-as-latex')'
     Export to a temporary buffer.  Do not create a file.  

`C-c C-e l p     (`org-latex-export-to-pdf')'
     Export as LaTeX and then process to PDF.

`C-c C-e l o'
     Export as LaTeX and then process to PDF, then open the resulting
     PDF file.

12.7.2 Header and sectioning structure
--------------------------------------

By default, the first three outline levels become headlines, defining a
general document structure.  Additional levels are exported as `itemize'
or `enumerate' lists.  The transition can also occur at a different
level (*note Export settings::).

   By default, the LaTeX output uses the class `article'.

   You can change this globally by setting a different value for
`org-latex-default-class' or locally by adding an option like
`#+LATEX_CLASS: myclass' in your file, or with a `EXPORT_LATEX_CLASS'
property that applies when exporting a region containing only this
(sub)tree.  The class must be listed in `org-latex-classes'.  This
variable defines a header template for each class(1), and allows you to
define the sectioning structure for each class.  You can also define
your own classes there.

   The `LATEX_CLASS_OPTIONS' keyword or `EXPORT_LATEX_CLASS_OPTIONS'
property can specify the options for the `\documentclass' macro.  These
options have to be provided, as expected by LaTeX, within square
brackets.

   You can also use the `LATEX_HEADER' and `LATEX_HEADER_EXTRA'(2)
keywords in order to add lines to the header.  See the docstring of
`org-latex-classes' for more information.

   An example is shown below.

     #+LATEX_CLASS: article
     #+LATEX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [a4paper]
     #+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage{xyz}

     * Headline 1
       some text

12.7.3 Quoting LaTeX code
-------------------------

Embedded LaTeX as described in *note Embedded LaTeX::, will be correctly
inserted into the LaTeX file.  Furthermore, you can add special code
that should only be present in LaTeX export with the following
constructs:

     Code within @@latex:some code@@ a paragraph.

     #+LATEX: Literal LaTeX code for export

     #+BEGIN_LATEX
     All lines between these markers are exported literally
     #+END_LATEX


File: org,  Node: LaTeX specific attributes,  Prev: Quoting LaTeX code,  Up: LaTeX and PDF export

12.7.4 LaTeX specific attributes
--------------------------------

LaTeX understands attributes specified in an `ATTR_LATEX' line.  They
affect tables, images, plain lists, special blocks and source blocks.

Tables in LaTeX export
......................

For LaTeX export of a table, you can specify a label and a caption
(*note Images and tables::).  You can also use attributes to control
table layout and contents.  Valid LaTeX attributes include:

`:mode'
     Nature of table's contents.  It can be set to `table', `math',
     `inline-math' or `verbatim'.  In particular, when in `math' or
     `inline-math' mode, every cell is exported as-is, horizontal rules
     are ignored and the table will be wrapped in a math environment.
     Also, contiguous tables sharing the same math mode will be wrapped
     within the same environment.  Default mode is determined in
     `org-latex-default-table-mode'.

`:environment'
     Environment used for the table.  It can be set to any LaTeX table
     environment, like `tabularx'(1), `longtable', `array', `tabu'(2),
     `bmatrix'... It defaults to `org-latex-default-table-environment'
     value.

`:caption'
     `#+CAPTION' keyword is the simplest way to set a caption for a
     table (*note Images and tables::).  If you need more advanced
     commands for that task, you can use `:caption' attribute instead.
     Its value should be raw LaTeX code.  It has precedence over
     `#+CAPTION'.

`:float'
`:placement'
     Float environment for the table.  Possible values are
     `sidewaystable', `multicolumn', `t' and `nil'.  When unspecified,
     a table with a caption will have a `table' environment.  Moreover,
     `:placement' attribute can specify the positioning of the float.

`:align'
`:font'
`:width'
     Set, respectively, the alignment string of the table, its font
     size and its width.  They only apply on regular tables.

`:spread'
     Boolean specific to the `tabu' and `longtabu' environments, and
     only takes effect when used in conjunction with the `:width'
     attribute.  When `:spread' is non-`nil', the table will be spread
     or shrunk by the value of `:width'.

`:booktabs'
`:center'
`:rmlines'
     They toggle, respectively, `booktabs' usage (assuming the package
     is properly loaded), table centering and removal of every
     horizontal rule but the first one (in a "table.el" table only).
     In particular, `org-latex-tables-booktabs' (respectively
     `org-latex-tables-centered') activates the first (respectively
     second) attribute globally.

`:math-prefix'
`:math-suffix'
`:math-arguments'
     A string that will be inserted, respectively, before the table
     within the math environment, after the table within the math
     environment, and between the macro name and the contents of the
     table.  The `:math-arguments' attribute is used for matrix macros
     that require more than one argument (e.g., `qbordermatrix').

   Thus, attributes can be used in a wide array of situations, like
writing a table that will span over multiple pages, or a matrix product:

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :environment longtable :align l|lp{3cm}r|l
     | ..... | ..... |
     | ..... | ..... |

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :mode math :environment bmatrix :math-suffix \times
     | a | b |
     | c | d |
     #+ATTR_LATEX: :mode math :environment bmatrix
     | 1 | 2 |
     | 3 | 4 |

   In the example below, LaTeX command `\bicaption{HeadingA}{HeadingB}'
will set the caption.

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :caption \bicaption{HeadingA}{HeadingB}
     | ..... | ..... |
     | ..... | ..... |

Images in LaTeX export
......................

Images that are linked to without a description part in the link, like
`[[file:img.jpg]]' or `[[./img.jpg]]' will be inserted into the PDF
output file resulting from LaTeX processing.  Org will use an
`\includegraphics' macro to insert the image(3).

   You can specify specify image width or height with, respectively,
`:width' and `:height' attributes.  It is also possible to add any
other option with the `:options' attribute, as shown in the following
example:

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 5cm :options angle=90
     [[./img/sed-hr4049.pdf]]

   If you need a specific command for the caption, use `:caption'
attribute.  It will override standard `#+CAPTION' value, if any.

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :caption \bicaption{HeadingA}{HeadingB}
     [[./img/sed-hr4049.pdf]]

   If you have specified a caption as described in *note Images and
tables::, the picture will be wrapped into a `figure' environment and
thus become a floating element.  You can also ask Org to export an
image as a float without specifying caption by setting the `:float'
attribute.  You may also set it to:
   - `t': if you want to use the standard `figure' environment.  It is
     used by default if you provide a caption to the image.

   - `multicolumn': if you wish to include an image which spans multiple
     columns in a page.  This will export the image wrapped in a
     `figure*' environment.

   - `wrap': if you would like to let text flow around the image.  It
     will make the figure occupy the left half of the page.

   - `nil': if you need to avoid any floating environment, even when a
     caption is provided.
   To modify the placement option of any floating environment, set the
`placement' attribute.

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :float wrap :width 0.38\textwidth :placement {r}{0.4\textwidth}
     [[./img/hst.png]]

   If the `:comment-include' attribute is set to a non-`nil' value, the
LaTeX `\includegraphics' macro will be commented out.

Plain lists in LaTeX export
...........................

Plain lists accept two optional attributes: `:environment' and
`:options'.  The first one allows the use of a non-standard environment
(e.g., `inparaenum').  The second one specifies additional arguments for
that environment.

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :environment compactitem :options [$\circ$]
     - you need ``paralist'' package to reproduce this example.

Source blocks in LaTeX export
.............................

In addition to syntax defined in *note Literal examples::, names and
captions (*note Images and tables::), source blocks also accept a
`:float' attribute.  You may set it to:
   - `t': if you want to make the source block a float.  It is the
     default value when a caption is provided.

   - `multicolumn': if you wish to include a source block which spans
     multiple columns in a page.

   - `nil': if you need to avoid any floating environment, even when a
     caption is provided.  It is useful for source code that may not
     fit in a single page.

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     Code that may not fit in a single page.
     #+END_SRC

Special blocks in LaTeX export
..............................

In LaTeX back-end, special blocks become environments of the same name.
Value of `:options' attribute will be appended as-is to that
environment's opening string.  For example:

     #+BEGIN_ABSTRACT
     We demonstrate how to solve the Syracuse problem.
     #+END_ABSTRACT

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Proof of important theorem]
     #+BEGIN_PROOF
     ...
     Therefore, any even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.
     #+END_PROOF

becomes

     \begin{abstract}
     We demonstrate how to solve the Syracuse problem.
     \end{abstract}

     \begin{proof}[Proof of important theorem]
     ...
     Therefore, any even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.
     \end{proof}

   If you need to insert a specific caption command, use `:caption'
attribute.  It will override standard `#+CAPTION' value, if any.  For
example:

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :caption \MyCaption{HeadingA}
     #+BEGIN_PROOF
     ...
     #+END_PROOF

Horizontal rules
................

Width and thickness of a given horizontal rule can be controlled with,
respectively, `:width' and `:thickness' attributes:

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :width .6\textwidth :thickness 0.8pt
     -----

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Requires adding the `tabularx' package to
`org-latex-packages-alist'.

   (2) Requires adding the `tabu' package to `org-latex-packages-alist'.

   (3) In the case of TikZ (`http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf/')
images, it will become an `\input' macro wrapped within a `tikzpicture'
environment.

12.8 Markdown export
====================

`md' export back-end generates Markdown syntax(1) for an Org mode
buffer.

   It is built over HTML back-end: any construct not supported by
Markdown syntax (e.g., tables) will be controlled and translated by
`html' back-end (*note HTML export::).

Markdown export commands
------------------------

`C-c C-e m m     (`org-md-export-to-markdown')'
     Export as a text file written in Markdown syntax.  For an Org file,
     `myfile.org', the resulting file will be `myfile.md'.  The file
     will be overwritten without warning.  

`C-c C-e m M     (`org-md-export-as-markdown')'
     Export to a temporary buffer.  Do not create a file.

`C-c C-e m o'
     Export as a text file with Markdown syntax, then open it.

Header and sectioning structure
-------------------------------

Markdown export can generate both `atx' and `setext' types for
headlines, according to `org-md-headline-style'.  The former introduces
a hard limit of two levels, whereas the latter pushes it to six.
Headlines below that limit are exported as lists.  You can also set a
soft limit before that one (*note Export settings::).

     convert the exported file to that format.  *Note Automatically
     exporting to other formats: x-export-to-other-formats.

     For an Org file `myfile.org', the ODT file will be `myfile.odt'.
     The file will be overwritten without warning.  If there is an
     active region,(1) only the region will be exported.  If the
     selected region is a single tree,(2) the tree head will become the
     document title.  If the tree head entry has, or inherits, an
     `EXPORT_FILE_NAME' property, that name will be used for the export.

     `C-c C-e o O' Export as an OpenDocument Text file and open the
     resulting file.

     If `org-odt-preferred-output-format' is specified, open the
     converted file instead.  *Note Automatically exporting to other

12.9.3 Extending ODT export
---------------------------

The ODT exporter can interface with a variety of document converters
and supports popular converters out of the box.  As a result, you can
use it to export to formats like `doc' or convert a document from one
format (say `csv') to another format (say `ods' or `xls').

   If you have a working installation of LibreOffice, a document
converter is pre-configured for you and you can use it right away.  If
you would like to use `unoconv' as your preferred converter, customize
the variable `org-odt-convert-process' to point to `unoconv'.  You can
also use your own favorite converter or tweak the default settings of
the `LibreOffice' and `unoconv' converters.  *Note Configuring a
document converter::.

12.9.3.1 Automatically exporting to other formats
.................................................

Very often, you will find yourself exporting to ODT format, only to
immediately save the exported document to other formats like `doc',
`docx', `rtf', `pdf' etc.  In such cases, you can specify your
preferred output format by customizing the variable
`org-odt-preferred-output-format'.  This way, the export commands
(*note Exporting to ODT: x-export-to-odt.) can be extended to export to
a format that is of immediate interest to you.

12.9.3.2 Converting between document formats
............................................

There are many document converters in the wild which support conversion
to and from various file formats, including, but not limited to the ODT
format.  LibreOffice converter, mentioned above, is one such converter.
Once a converter is configured, you can interact with it using the
following command.

`M-x org-odt-convert RET'
     Convert an existing document from one format to another.  With a
     prefix argument, also open the newly produced file.

12.9.4 Applying custom styles
-----------------------------

The ODT exporter ships with a set of OpenDocument styles (*note Working
with OpenDocument style files::) that ensure a well-formatted output.
These factory styles, however, may not cater to your specific tastes.
To customize the output, you can either modify the above styles files
directly, or generate the required styles using an application like
LibreOffice.  The latter method is suitable for expert and non-expert
users alike, and is described here.

12.9.4.1 Applying custom styles: the easy way
.............................................

  1. Create a sample `example.org' file with the below settings and
     export it to ODT format.

          #+OPTIONS: H:10 num:t

  2. Open the above `example.odt' using LibreOffice.  Use the `Stylist'
     to locate the target styles--these typically have the `Org'
     prefix--and modify those to your taste.  Save the modified file
     either as an OpenDocument Text (`.odt') or OpenDocument Template
     (`.ott') file.

  3. Customize the variable `org-odt-styles-file' and point it to the
     newly created file.  For additional configuration options *note
     Overriding factory styles: x-overriding-factory-styles.

     If you would like to choose a style on a per-file basis, you can
     use the `#+ODT_STYLES_FILE' option.  A typical setting will look
     like

          #+ODT_STYLES_FILE: "/path/to/example.ott"

     or

          #+ODT_STYLES_FILE: ("/path/to/file.ott" ("styles.xml" "image/hdr.png"))


12.9.4.2 Using third-party styles and templates
...............................................

You can use third-party styles and templates for customizing your
output.  This will produce the desired output only if the template
provides all style names that the `ODT' exporter relies on.  Unless
this condition is met, the output is going to be less than
satisfactory.  So it is highly recommended that you only work with
templates that are directly derived from the factory settings.


File: org,  Node: Links in ODT export,  Next: Tables in ODT export,  Prev: Applying custom styles,  Up: OpenDocument Text export

12.9.5 Links in ODT export
--------------------------

ODT exporter creates native cross-references for internal links.  It
creates Internet-style links for all other links.

   A link with no description and destined to a regular (un-itemized)
outline heading is replaced with a cross-reference and section number
of the heading.

   A `\ref{label}'-style reference to an image, table etc. is replaced
with a cross-reference and sequence number of the labeled entity.
*Note Labels and captions in ODT export::.


File: org,  Node: Tables in ODT export,  Next: Images in ODT export,  Prev: Links in ODT export,  Up: OpenDocument Text export

12.9.6 Tables in ODT export
---------------------------

Export of native Org mode tables (*note Tables::) and simple `table.el'
tables is supported.  However, export of complex `table.el'
tables--tables that have column or row spans--is not supported.  Such
tables are stripped from the exported document.

   By default, a table is exported with top and bottom frames and with
rules separating row and column groups (*note Column groups::).
Furthermore, all tables are typeset to occupy the same width.  If the
table specifies alignment and relative width for its columns (*note
Column width and alignment::) then these are honored on export.(1)

   You can control the width of the table by specifying `:rel-width'
property using an `#+ATTR_ODT' line.

   For example, consider the following table which makes use of all the
rules mentioned above.

     #+ATTR_ODT: :rel-width 50
     | Area/Month    |   Jan |   Feb |   Mar |   Sum |
     |---------------+-------+-------+-------+-------|
     | /             |     < |       |       |     < |
     | <l13>         |  <r5> |  <r5> |  <r5> |  <r6> |
     | North America |     1 |    21 |   926 |   948 |
     | Middle East   |     6 |    75 |   844 |   925 |
     | Asia Pacific  |     9 |    27 |   790 |   826 |
     |---------------+-------+-------+-------+-------|
     | Sum           |    16 |   123 |  2560 |  2699 |

   On export, the table will occupy 50% of text area.  The columns will
be sized (roughly) in the ratio of 13:5:5:5:6.  The first column will
be left-aligned and rest of the columns will be right-aligned.  There
will be vertical rules after separating the header and last columns
from other columns.  There will be horizontal rules separating the
header and last rows from other rows.

   If you are not satisfied with the above formatting options, you can
create custom table styles and associate them with a table using the
`#+ATTR_ODT' line.  *Note Customizing tables in ODT export::.

   (1) The column widths are interpreted as weighted ratios with the
default weight being 1

12.9.7 Images in ODT export
---------------------------

Embedding images
................

You can embed images within the exported document by providing a link
to the desired image file with no link description.  For example, to
embed `img.png' do either of the following:

     [[file:img.png]]

     [[./img.png]]

Embedding clickable images
..........................

You can create clickable images by providing a link whose description
is a link to an image file.  For example, to embed a image
`org-mode-unicorn.png' which when clicked jumps to `http://Orgmode.org'
website, do the following

     [[http://orgmode.org][./org-mode-unicorn.png]]

Sizing and scaling of embedded images
.....................................

You can control the size and scale of the embedded images using the
`#+ATTR_ODT' attribute.

   The exporter specifies the desired size of the image in the final
document in units of centimeters.  In order to scale the embedded
images, the exporter queries for pixel dimensions of the images using
one of a) ImageMagick's `identify' program or b) Emacs `create-image'
and `image-size' APIs(1). The pixel dimensions are subsequently
converted in to units of centimeters using `org-odt-pixels-per-inch'.
The default value of this variable is set to `display-pixels-per-inch'.
You can tweak this variable to achieve the best results.

   The examples below illustrate the various possibilities.

Explicitly size the image
     To embed `img.png' as a 10 cm x 10 cm image, do the following:

          #+ATTR_ODT: :width 10 :height 10
          [[./img.png]]

Scale the image
     To embed `img.png' at half its size, do the following:

          #+ATTR_ODT: :scale 0.5
          [[./img.png]]

Scale the image to a specific width
     To embed `img.png' with a width of 10 cm while retaining the
     original height:width ratio, do the following:

          #+ATTR_ODT: :width 10
          [[./img.png]]

Scale the image to a specific height
     To embed `img.png' with a height of 10 cm while retaining the
     original height:width ratio, do the following

          #+ATTR_ODT: :height 10
          [[./img.png]]

Anchoring of images
...................

You can control the manner in which an image is anchored by setting the
`:anchor' property of it's `#+ATTR_ODT' line.  You can specify one of
the the following three values for the `:anchor' property: `"as-char"',
`"paragraph"' and `"page"'.

   To create an image that is anchored to a page, do the following:
     #+ATTR_ODT: :anchor "page"
     [[./img.png]]

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Use of `ImageMagick' is only desirable.  However, if you
routinely produce documents that have large images or you export your
Org files that has images using a Emacs batch script, then the use of
`ImageMagick' is mandatory.

12.9.8.1 Working with LaTeX math snippets
.........................................

LaTeX math snippets (*note LaTeX fragments::) can be embedded in the ODT
document in one of the following ways:

  1. MathML

     This option is activated on a per-file basis with

          #+OPTIONS: LaTeX:t

     With this option, LaTeX fragments are first converted into MathML
     fragments using an external LaTeX-to-MathML converter program.  The
     resulting MathML fragments are then embedded as an OpenDocument
     Formula in the exported document.

     You can specify the LaTeX-to-MathML converter by customizing the
     variables `org-latex-to-mathml-convert-command' and
     `org-latex-to-mathml-jar-file'.

     If you prefer to use `MathToWeb'(1) as your converter, you can
     configure the above variables as shown below.

          (setq org-latex-to-mathml-convert-command
                "java -jar %j -unicode -force -df %o %I"
                org-latex-to-mathml-jar-file
                "/path/to/mathtoweb.jar")

     You can use the following commands to quickly verify the
     reliability of the LaTeX-to-MathML converter.

    `M-x org-odt-export-as-odf RET'
          Convert a LaTeX math snippet to an OpenDocument formula
          (`.odf') file.

    `M-x org-odt-export-as-odf-and-open RET'
          Convert a LaTeX math snippet to an OpenDocument formula
          (`.odf') file and open the formula file with the
          system-registered application.

  2. PNG images

     This option is activated on a per-file basis with

          #+OPTIONS: tex:dvipng

     or:

          #+OPTIONS: tex:imagemagick

     With this option, LaTeX fragments are processed into PNG images
     and the resulting images are embedded in the exported document.
     This method requires that the `dvipng' program or `imagemagick'
     suite be available on your system.

formula (`.odf') file as shown below:

     [[./equation.mml]]

   or

     [[./equation.odf]]

12.9.9 Labels and captions in ODT export
----------------------------------------

You can label and caption various category of objects--an inline image,
a table, a LaTeX fragment or a Math formula--using `#+LABEL' and
`#+CAPTION' lines.  *Note Images and tables::.  ODT exporter enumerates
each labeled or captioned object of a given category separately.  As a
result, each such object is assigned a sequence number based on order
of it's appearance in the Org file.

   In the exported document, a user-provided caption is augmented with
the category and sequence number.  Consider the following inline image
in an Org file.

     #+CAPTION: Bell curve
     #+LABEL:   fig:SED-HR4049
     [[./img/a.png]]

   It could be rendered as shown below in the exported document.

     Figure 2: Bell curve

   You can modify the category component of the caption by customizing
the option `org-odt-category-map-alist'.  For example, to tag all
embedded images with the string `Illustration' (instead of the default
`Figure') use the following setting:

     (setq org-odt-category-map-alist
           (("__Figure__" "Illustration" "value" "Figure" org-odt--enumerable-image-p)))

   With this, previous image will be captioned as below in the exported
document.

12.9.10 Literal examples in ODT export
--------------------------------------

Export of literal examples (*note Literal examples::) with full
fontification is supported.  Internally, the exporter relies on
`htmlfontify.el' to generate all style definitions needed for a fancy
listing.(1)  The auto-generated styles have `OrgSrc' as prefix and
inherit their color from the faces used by Emacs `font-lock' library
for the source language.

   If you prefer to use your own custom styles for fontification, you
can do so by customizing the option
`org-odt-create-custom-styles-for-srcblocks'.

   You can turn off fontification of literal examples by customizing the
option `org-odt-fontify-srcblocks'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Your `htmlfontify.el' library must at least be at Emacs 24.1
levels for fontification to be turned on.

12.9.11.1 Configuring a document converter
..........................................

The ODT exporter can work with popular converters with little or no
extra configuration from your side. *Note Extending ODT export::.  If
you are using a converter that is not supported by default or if you
would like to tweak the default converter settings, proceed as below.

  1. Register the converter

     Name your converter and add it to the list of known converters by
     customizing the option `org-odt-convert-processes'.  Also specify
     how the converter can be invoked via command-line to effect the
     conversion.

  2. Configure its capabilities

     Specify the set of formats the converter can handle by customizing
     the variable `org-odt-convert-capabilities'.  Use the default
     value for this variable as a guide for configuring your converter.
     As suggested by the default setting, you can specify the full set
     of formats supported by the converter and not limit yourself to
     specifying formats that are related to just the OpenDocument Text
     format.

  3. Choose the converter

     Select the newly added converter as the preferred one by
     customizing the option `org-odt-convert-process'.

12.9.11.2 Working with OpenDocument style files
...............................................

This section explores the internals of the ODT exporter and the means
by which it produces styled documents.  Read this section if you are
interested in exploring the automatic and custom OpenDocument styles
used by the exporter.

Factory styles
..............

The ODT exporter relies on two files for generating its output.  These
files are bundled with the distribution under the directory pointed to
by the variable `org-odt-styles-dir'.  The two files are:

   * `OrgOdtStyles.xml'

     This file contributes to the `styles.xml' file of the final `ODT'
     document.  This file gets modified for the following purposes:
       1. To control outline numbering based on user settings.

       2. To add styles generated by `htmlfontify.el' for fontification
          of code blocks.

   * `OrgOdtContentTemplate.xml'

     This file contributes to the `content.xml' file of the final `ODT'
     document.  The contents of the Org outline are inserted between the
     `<office:text>'...`</office:text>' elements of this file.

     Apart from serving as a template file for the final `content.xml',
     the file serves the following purposes:
       1. It contains automatic styles for formatting of tables which
          are referenced by the exporter.

       2. It contains `<text:sequence-decl>'...`</text:sequence-decl>'
          elements that control how various entities--tables, images,
          equations, etc.--are numbered.

Overriding factory styles
.........................

The following two variables control the location from which the ODT
exporter picks up the custom styles and content template files.  You can
customize these variables to override the factory styles used by the
exporter.

   * `org-odt-styles-file'

     Use this variable to specify the `styles.xml' that will be used in
     the final output.  You can specify one of the following values:

       1. A `styles.xml' file

          Use this file instead of the default `styles.xml'

       2. A `.odt' or `.ott' file

          Use the `styles.xml' contained in the specified OpenDocument
          Text or Template file

       3. A `.odt' or `.ott' file and a subset of files contained
          within them

          Use the `styles.xml' contained in the specified OpenDocument
          Text or Template file.  Additionally extract the specified
          member files and embed those within the final `ODT' document.

          Use this option if the `styles.xml' file references
          additional files like header and footer images.

       4. `nil'

          Use the default `styles.xml'

   * `org-odt-content-template-file'

     Use this variable to specify the blank `content.xml' that will be
     used in the final output.

12.9.11.3 Creating one-off styles
.................................

There are times when you would want one-off formatting in the exported
document.  You can achieve this by embedding raw OpenDocument XML in
the Org file.  The use of this feature is better illustrated with
couple of examples.

  1. Embedding ODT tags as part of regular text

     You can inline OpenDocument syntax by enclosing it within
     `@@odt:...@@' markup.  For example, to highlight a region of text
     do the following:

          @@odt:<text:span text:style-name="Highlight">This is a highlighted
          text</text:span>@@.  But this is a regular text.

     *Hint:* To see the above example in action, edit your `styles.xml'
     (*note Factory styles: x-orgodtstyles-xml.) and add a custom
     `Highlight' style as shown below.

          <style:style style:name="Highlight" style:family="text">
            <style:text-properties fo:background-color="#ff0000"/>
          </style:style>

  2. Embedding a one-line OpenDocument XML

     You can add a simple OpenDocument one-liner using the `#+ODT:'
     directive.  For example, to force a page break do the following:

          #+ODT: <text:p text:style-name="PageBreak"/>

     *Hint:* To see the above example in action, edit your `styles.xml'
     (*note Factory styles: x-orgodtstyles-xml.) and add a custom
     `PageBreak' style as shown below.

          <style:style style:name="PageBreak" style:family="paragraph"
                       style:parent-style-name="Text_20_body">
            <style:paragraph-properties fo:break-before="page"/>
          </style:style>

  3. Embedding a block of OpenDocument XML

     You can add a large block of OpenDocument XML using the
     `#+BEGIN_ODT'...`#+END_ODT' construct.

     For example, to create a one-off paragraph that uses bold text, do
     the following:

          #+BEGIN_ODT
          <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body_20_bold">
          This paragraph is specially formatted and uses bold text.
          </text:p>
          #+END_ODT

12.9.11.4 Customizing tables in ODT export
..........................................

You can override the default formatting of the table by specifying a
custom table style with the `#+ATTR_ODT' line.  For a discussion on
default formatting of tables *note Tables in ODT export::.

   This feature closely mimics the way table templates are defined in
the OpenDocument-v1.2 specification.(1)

Custom table styles: an illustration
....................................

To have a quick preview of this feature, install the below setting and
export the table that follows:

     (setq org-odt-table-styles
           (append org-odt-table-styles
                 '(("TableWithHeaderRowAndColumn" "Custom"
                     ((use-first-row-styles . t)
                      (use-first-column-styles . t)))
                     ("TableWithFirstRowandLastRow" "Custom"
                      ((use-first-row-styles . t)
                      (use-last-row-styles . t))))))

     #+ATTR_ODT: :style "TableWithHeaderRowAndColumn"
     | Name  | Phone | Age |
     | Peter |  1234 |  17 |
     | Anna  |  4321 |  25 |

   In the above example, you used a template named `Custom' and
installed two table styles with the names `TableWithHeaderRowAndColumn'
and `TableWithFirstRowandLastRow'.  (*Important:* The OpenDocument
styles needed for producing the above template have been pre-defined for
you.  These styles are available under the section marked `Custom Table
Template' in `OrgOdtContentTemplate.xml' (*note Factory styles:
x-orgodtcontenttemplate-xml.).  If you need additional templates you
have to define these styles yourselves.

Custom table styles: the nitty-gritty
.....................................

To use this feature proceed as follows:

  1. Create a table template(2)

     A table template is nothing but a set of `table-cell' and
     `paragraph' styles for each of the following table cell categories:

        - Body

        - First column

        - Last column

        - First row

        - Last row

        - Even row

        - Odd row

        - Even column

        - Odd Column

     The names for the above styles must be chosen based on the name of
     the table template using a well-defined convention.

     The naming convention is better illustrated with an example.  For
     a table template with the name `Custom', the needed style names
     are listed in the following table.

     Table cell type   `table-cell' style          `paragraph' style
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

     Body              `CustomTableCell'           `CustomTableParagraph'
     First column      `CustomFirstColumnTableCell'`CustomFirstColumnTableParagraph'
     Last column       `CustomLastColumnTableCell' `CustomLastColumnTableParagraph'
     First row         `CustomFirstRowTableCell'   `CustomFirstRowTableParagraph'
     Last row          `CustomLastRowTableCell'    `CustomLastRowTableParagraph'
     Even row          `CustomEvenRowTableCell'    `CustomEvenRowTableParagraph'
     Odd row           `CustomOddRowTableCell'     `CustomOddRowTableParagraph'
     Even column       `CustomEvenColumnTableCell' `CustomEvenColumnTableParagraph'
     Odd column        `CustomOddColumnTableCell'  `CustomOddColumnTableParagraph'

     To create a table template with the name `Custom', define the above
     styles in the
     `<office:automatic-styles>'...`</office:automatic-styles>' element
     of the content template file (*note Factory styles:
     x-orgodtcontenttemplate-xml.).

  2. Define a table style(3)

     To define a table style, create an entry for the style in the
     variable `org-odt-table-styles' and specify the following:

        - the name of the table template created in step (1)

        - the set of cell styles in that template that are to be
          activated

     For example, the entry below defines two different table styles
     `TableWithHeaderRowAndColumn' and `TableWithFirstRowandLastRow'
     based on the same template `Custom'.  The styles achieve their
     intended effect by selectively activating the individual cell
     styles in that template.

          (setq org-odt-table-styles
                (append org-odt-table-styles
                        '(("TableWithHeaderRowAndColumn" "Custom"
                           ((use-first-row-styles . t)
                            (use-first-column-styles . t)))
                          ("TableWithFirstRowandLastRow" "Custom"
                           ((use-first-row-styles . t)
                            (use-last-row-styles . t))))))

  3. Associate a table with the table style

     To do this, specify the table style created in step (2) as part of
     the `ATTR_ODT' line as shown below.

          #+ATTR_ODT: :style "TableWithHeaderRowAndColumn"
          | Name  | Phone | Age |
          | Peter |  1234 |  17 |
          | Anna  |  4321 |  25 |

12.9.11.5 Validating OpenDocument XML
.....................................

Occasionally, you will discover that the document created by the ODT
exporter cannot be opened by your favorite application.  One of the
common reasons for this is that the `.odt' file is corrupt.  In such
cases, you may want to validate the document against the OpenDocument
RELAX NG Compact Syntax (RNC) schema.

   For de-compressing the `.odt' file(1): *note (emacs)File Archives::.
For general help with validation (and schema-sensitive editing) of XML
files: *note (nxml-mode)Introduction::.

   If you have ready access to OpenDocument `.rnc' files and the needed
schema-locating rules in a single folder, you can customize the variable
`org-odt-schema-dir' to point to that directory.  The ODT exporter will
take care of updating the `rng-schema-locating-files' for you.

12.10 Org export
================

`org' export back-end creates a normalized version of the Org document
in current buffer.  In particular, it evaluates Babel code (*note
Evaluating code blocks::) and removes other back-ends specific contents.

Org export commands
-------------------

`C-c C-e O o     (`org-org-export-to-org')'
     Export as an Org document.  For an Org file, `myfile.org', the
     resulting file will be `myfile.org.org'.  The file will be
     overwritten without warning.  

`C-c C-e O O     (`org-org-export-as-org')'
     Export to a temporary buffer.  Do not create a file.

`C-c C-e O v'
     Export to an Org file, then open it.


File: org,  Node: iCalendar export,  Next: Other built-in back-ends,  Prev: Org export,  Up: Exporting

12.11 iCalendar export
======================

Some people use Org mode for keeping track of projects, but still
prefer a standard calendar application for anniversaries and
appointments.  In this case it can be useful to show deadlines and
other time-stamped items in Org files in the calendar application.  Org
mode can export calendar information in the standard iCalendar format.
If you also want to have TODO entries included in the export, configure
the variable `org-icalendar-include-todo'.  Plain timestamps are
exported as VEVENT, and TODO items as VTODO.  It will also create
events from deadlines that are in non-TODO items.  Deadlines and
scheduling dates in TODO items will be used to set the start and due
dates for the TODO entry(1).  As categories, it will use the tags
locally defined in the heading, and the file/tree category(2).  See the
variable `org-icalendar-alarm-time' for a way to assign alarms to
entries with a time.

   The iCalendar standard requires each entry to have a globally unique
identifier (UID).  Org creates these identifiers during export.  If you
set the variable `org-icalendar-store-UID', the UID will be stored in
the `:ID:' property of the entry and re-used next time you report this
entry.  Since a single entry can give rise to multiple iCalendar
entries (as a timestamp, a deadline, a scheduled item, and as a TODO
item), Org adds prefixes to the UID, depending on what triggered the
inclusion of the entry.  In this way the UID remains unique, but a
synchronization program can still figure out from which entry all the
different instances originate.

`C-c C-e c f     (`org-icalendar-export-to-ics')'
     Create iCalendar entries for the current buffer and store them in
     the same directory, using a file extension `.ics'.  

`C-c C-e c a     (`org-icalendar-export-agenda-files')'
     Like `C-c C-e c f', but do this for all files in
     `org-agenda-files'.  For each of these files, a separate iCalendar
     file will be written.  

`C-c C-e c c     (`org-icalendar-combine-agenda-files')'
     Create a single large iCalendar file from all files in
     `org-agenda-files' and write it to the file given by
     `org-icalendar-combined-agenda-file'.

   The export will honor SUMMARY, DESCRIPTION and LOCATION(3)
properties if the selected entries have them.  If not, the summary will
be derived from the headline, and the description from the body
(limited to `org-icalendar-include-body' characters).

   How this calendar is best read and updated, depends on the
application you are using.  The FAQ covers this issue.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See the variables `org-icalendar-use-deadline' and
`org-icalendar-use-scheduled'.

   (2) To add inherited tags or the TODO state, configure the variable
`org-icalendar-categories'.

   (3) The LOCATION property can be inherited from higher in the
hierarchy if you configure `org-use-property-inheritance' accordingly.

12.12 Other built-in back-ends
==============================

On top of the aforementioned back-ends, Org comes with other built-in
ones:

   * `ox-man.el': export to a man page.

   * `ox-texinfo.el': export to `Texinfo' format.

   To activate these export back-end, customize `org-export-backends' or
load them directly with e.g., `(require 'ox-texinfo)'.  This will add
new keys in the export dispatcher (*note The Export Dispatcher::).

   See the comment section of these files for more information on how
to use them.


File: org,  Node: Export in foreign buffers,  Next: Advanced configuration,  Prev: Other built-in back-ends,  Up: Exporting

12.13 Export in foreign buffers
===============================

Most built-in back-ends come with a command to convert the selected
region into a selected format and replace this region by the exported
output.  Here is a list of such conversion commands:

`org-html-convert-region-to-html'
     Convert the selected region into HTML.

`org-latex-convert-region-to-latex'
     Convert the selected region into LaTeX.

`org-texinfo-convert-region-to-texinfo'
     Convert the selected region into `Texinfo'.

`org-md-convert-region-to-md'
     Convert the selected region into `MarkDown'.

   This is particularly useful for converting tables and lists in
foreign buffers.  E.g., in an HTML buffer, you can turn on
`orgstruct-mode', then use Org commands for editing a list, and finally
select and convert the list with `M-x org-html-convert-region-to-html
RET'.

12.14 Advanced configuration
============================

Hooks
-----

Two hooks are run during the first steps of the export process.  The
first one, `org-export-before-processing-hook' is called before
expanding macros, Babel code and include keywords in the buffer.  The
second one, `org-export-before-parsing-hook', as its name suggests,
happens just before parsing the buffer.  Their main use is for heavy
duties, that is duties involving structural modifications of the
document.  For example, one may want to remove every headline in the
buffer during export.  The following code can achieve this:

     (defun my-headline-removal (backend)
       "Remove all headlines in the current buffer.
     BACKEND is the export back-end being used, as a symbol."
       (org-map-entries
        (lambda () (delete-region (point) (progn (forward-line) (point))))))

     (add-hook 'org-export-before-parsing-hook 'my-headline-removal)

   Note that functions used in these hooks require a mandatory argument,
a symbol representing the back-end used.

Filters
-------

Filters are lists of functions applied on a specific part of the output
from a given back-end.  More explicitly, each time a back-end
transforms an Org object or element into another language, all
functions within a given filter type are called in turn on the string
produced.  The string returned by the last function will be the one
used in the final output.

   There are filters sets for each type of element or object, for plain
text, for the parse tree, for the export options and for the final
output.  They are all named after the same scheme:
`org-export-filter-TYPE-functions', where `TYPE' is the type targeted
by the filter.  Valid types are:

bold                     babel-call               center-block
clock                    code                     comment
comment-block            diary-sexp               drawer
dynamic-block            entity                   example-block
export-block             export-snippet           final-output
fixed-width              footnote-definition      footnote-reference
headline                 horizontal-rule          inline-babel-call
inline-src-block         inlinetask               italic
item                     keyword                  latex-environment
latex-fragment           line-break               link
node-property            options                  paragraph
parse-tree               plain-list               plain-text
planning                 property-drawer          quote-block
quote-section            radio-target             section
special-block            src-block                statistics-cookie
strike-through           subscript                superscript
table                    table-cell               table-row
target                   timestamp                underline
verbatim                 verse-block              

   For example, the following snippet allows me to use non-breaking
spaces in the Org buffer and get them translated into LaTeX without
using the `\nbsp' macro (where `_' stands for the non-breaking space):

     (defun my-latex-filter-nobreaks (text backend info)
       "Ensure \" \" are properly handled in LaTeX export."
       (when (org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'latex)
             (replace-regexp-in-string " " "~" text)))

     (add-to-list 'org-export-filter-plain-text-functions
                  'my-latex-filter-nobreaks)

   Three arguments must be provided to a filter: the code being
changed, the back-end used, and some information about the export
process.  You can safely ignore the third argument for most purposes.
Note the use of `org-export-derived-backend-p', which ensures that the
filter will only be applied when using `latex' back-end or any other
back-end derived from it (e.g., `beamer').

Extending an existing back-end
------------------------------

This is obviously the most powerful customization, since the changes
happen at the parser level.  Indeed, some export back-ends are built as
extensions of other ones (e.g. Markdown back-end an extension of HTML
back-end).

   Extending a back-end means that if an element type is not transcoded
by the new back-end, it will be handled by the original one.  Hence you
can extend specific parts of a back-end without too much work.

   As an example, imagine we want the `ascii' back-end to display the
language used in a source block, when it is available, but only when
some attribute is non-`nil', like the following:

     #+ATTR_ASCII: :language t

   Because that back-end is lacking in that area, we are going to
create a new back-end, `my-ascii' that will do the job.

     (defun my-ascii-src-block (src-block contents info)
       "Transcode a SRC-BLOCK element from Org to ASCII.
     CONTENTS is nil.  INFO is a plist used as a communication
     channel."
       (if (not (org-export-read-attribute :attr_ascii src-block :language))
         (org-export-with-backend 'ascii src-block contents info)
       (concat
        (format ",--[ %s ]--\n%s`----"
                (org-element-property :language src-block)
                (replace-regexp-in-string
                 "^" "| "
                 (org-element-normalize-string
                  (org-export-format-code-default src-block info)))))))

     (org-export-define-derived-backend 'my-ascii 'ascii
       :translate-alist '((src-block . my-ascii-src-block)))

   The `my-ascii-src-block' function looks at the attribute above the
element.  If it isn't true, it gives hand to the `ascii' back-end.
Otherwise, it creates a box around the code, leaving room for the
language.  A new back-end is then created.  It only changes its
behavior when translating `src-block' type element.  Now, all it takes
to use the new back-end is calling the following from an Org buffer:

     (org-export-to-buffer 'my-ascii "*Org MY-ASCII Export*")

   It is obviously possible to write an interactive function for this,
install it in the export dispatcher menu, and so on.

13 Publishing
*************

Org includes a publishing management system that allows you to configure
automatic HTML conversion of _projects_ composed of interlinked org
files.  You can also configure Org to automatically upload your
exported HTML pages and related attachments, such as images and source
code files, to a web server.

   You can also use Org to convert files into PDF, or even combine HTML
and PDF conversion so that files are available in both formats on the
server.

   Publishing has been contributed to Org by David O'Toole.

File: org,  Node: Project alist,  Next: Sources and destinations,  Prev: Configuration,  Up: Configuration

13.1.1 The variable `org-publish-project-alist'
-----------------------------------------------

Publishing is configured almost entirely through setting the value of
one variable, called `org-publish-project-alist'.  Each element of the
list configures one project, and may be in one of the two following
forms:

        ("project-name" :property value :property value ...)
          i.e., a well-formed property list with alternating keys and values
     or
        ("project-name" :components ("project-name" "project-name" ...))

   In both cases, projects are configured by specifying property
values.  A project defines the set of files that will be published, as
well as the publishing configuration to use when publishing those
files.  When a project takes the second form listed above, the
individual members of the `:components' property are taken to be
sub-projects, which group together files requiring different publishing
options.  When you publish such a "meta-project", all the components
will also be published, in the sequence given.


File: org,  Node: Sources and destinations,  Next: Selecting files,  Prev: Project alist,  Up: Configuration

13.1.2 Sources and destinations for files
-----------------------------------------

Most properties are optional, but some should always be set.  In
particular, Org needs to know where to look for source files, and where
to put published files.

`:base-directory'      Directory containing publishing source files
`:publishing-directory'Directory where output files will be published.
                       You can directly publish to a web server using a
                       file name syntax appropriate for the Emacs
                       `tramp' package.  Or you can publish to a local
                       directory and use external tools to upload your
                       website (*note Uploading files::).
`:preparation-function'Function or list of functions to be called before
                       starting the publishing process, for example, to
                       run `make' for updating files to be published.
                       The project property list is scoped into this
                       call as the variable `project-plist'.
`:completion-function' Function or list of functions called after
                       finishing the publishing process, for example, to
                       change permissions of the resulting files.  The
                       project property list is scoped into this call as
                       the variable `project-plist'.


File: org,  Node: Selecting files,  Next: Publishing action,  Prev: Sources and destinations,  Up: Configuration

13.1.3 Selecting files
----------------------

By default, all files with extension `.org' in the base directory are
considered part of the project.  This can be modified by setting the
properties
`:base-extension'  Extension (without the dot!) of source files.  This
                   actually is a regular expression.  Set this to the
                   symbol `any' if you want to get all files in
                   `:base-directory', even without extension.
`:exclude'         Regular expression to match file names that should
                   not be published, even though they have been selected
                   on the basis of their extension.
`:include'         List of files to be included regardless of
                   `:base-extension' and `:exclude'.
`:recursive'       non-`nil' means, check base-directory recursively for
                   files to publish.


File: org,  Node: Publishing action,  Next: Publishing options,  Prev: Selecting files,  Up: Configuration

13.1.4 Publishing action
------------------------

Publishing means that a file is copied to the destination directory and
possibly transformed in the process.  The default transformation is to
export Org files as HTML files, and this is done by the function
`org-html-publish-to-html', which calls the HTML exporter (*note HTML
export::).  But you also can publish your content as PDF files using
`org-latex-publish-to-pdf' or as `ascii', `Texinfo', etc., using the
corresponding functions.

   If you want to publish the Org file as an `.org' file but with the
archived, commented and tag-excluded trees removed, use the function
`org-org-publish-to-org'.  This will produce `file.org' and put it in
the publishing directory.  If you want a htmlized version of this file,
set the parameter `:htmlized-source' to `t', it will produce
`file.org.html' in the publishing directory(1).

   Other files like images only need to be copied to the publishing
destination.  For this you can use `org-publish-attachment'.  For
non-org files, you always need to specify the publishing function:

`:publishing-function' Function executing the publication of a file.
                       This may also be a list of functions, which will
                       all be called in turn.
`:htmlized-source'     non-`nil' means, publish htmlized source.

   The function must accept three arguments: a property list containing
at least a `:publishing-directory' property, the name of the file to be
published and the path to the publishing directory of the output file.
It should take the specified file, make the necessary transformation
(if any) and place the result into the destination folder.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If the publishing directory is the same than the source
directory, `file.org' will be exported as `file.org.org', so probably
don't want to do this.

exporters.  In most cases, these properties correspond to user
variables in Org.  The first table below lists these properties along
with the variable they belong to.  The second table list HTML specific
properties.  See the documentation string of these options for details.

   Most of the `org-export-with-*' variables have the same effect in
each exporter.

   When a property is given a value in `org-publish-project-alist', its
setting overrides the value of the corresponding user variable (if any)
during publishing.  Options set within a file (*note Export settings::),
however, override everything.


File: org,  Node: Publishing links,  Next: Sitemap,  Prev: Publishing options,  Up: Configuration

13.1.6 Links between published files
------------------------------------

To create a link from one Org file to another, you would use something
like `[[file:foo.org][The foo]]' or simply `file:foo.org.' (*note
Hyperlinks::).  When published, this link becomes a link to `foo.html'.
You can thus interlink the pages of your "org web" project and the
links will work as expected when you publish them to HTML.  If you also
publish the Org source file and want to link to it, use an `http:' link
instead of a `file:' link, because `file:' links are converted to link
to the corresponding `html' file.

   You may also link to related files, such as images.  Provided you
are careful with relative file names, and provided you have also
configured Org to upload the related files, these links will work too.
See *note Complex example::, for an example of this usage.


File: org,  Node: Sitemap,  Next: Generating an index,  Prev: Publishing links,  Up: Configuration

13.1.7 Generating a sitemap
---------------------------

The following properties may be used to control publishing of a map of
files for a given project.

`:auto-sitemap'           When non-`nil', publish a sitemap during
                          `org-publish-current-project' or
                          `org-publish-all'.
`:sitemap-filename'       Filename for output of sitemap.  Defaults to
                          `sitemap.org' (which becomes `sitemap.html').
`:sitemap-title'          Title of sitemap page.  Defaults to name of
                          file.
`:sitemap-function'       Plug-in function to use for generation of the
                          sitemap.  Defaults to
                          `org-publish-org-sitemap', which generates a
                          plain list of links to all files in the
                          project.
`:sitemap-sort-folders'   Where folders should appear in the sitemap.
                          Set this to `first' (default) or `last' to
                          display folders first or last, respectively.
                          Any other value will mix files and folders.
`:sitemap-sort-files'     How the files are sorted in the site map.  Set
                          this to `alphabetically' (default),
                          `chronologically' or `anti-chronologically'.
                          `chronologically' sorts the files with older
                          date first while `anti-chronologically' sorts
                          the files with newer date first.
                          `alphabetically' sorts the files
                          alphabetically.  The date of a file is
                          retrieved with `org-publish-find-date'.
`:sitemap-ignore-case'    Should sorting be case-sensitive?  Default
                          `nil'.
`:sitemap-file-entry-format'With this option one can tell how a sitemap's
                          entry is formatted in the sitemap.  This is a
                          format string with some escape sequences: `%t'
                          stands for the title of the file, `%a' stands
                          for the author of the file and `%d' stands for
                          the date of the file.  The date is retrieved
                          with the `org-publish-find-date' function and
                          formatted with
                          `org-publish-sitemap-date-format'.  Default
                          `%t'.
`:sitemap-date-format'    Format string for the `format-time-string'
                          function that tells how a sitemap entry's date
                          is to be formatted.  This property bypasses
                          `org-publish-sitemap-date-format' which
                          defaults to `%Y-%m-%d'.
`:sitemap-sans-extension' When non-`nil', remove filenames' extensions
                          from the generated sitemap.  Useful to have
                          cool URIs (see
                          `http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI').
                          Defaults to `nil'.


File: org,  Node: Generating an index,  Prev: Sitemap,  Up: Configuration

13.1.8 Generating an index
--------------------------

Org mode can generate an index across the files of a publishing project.

`:makeindex'       When non-`nil', generate in index in the file
                   `theindex.org' and publish it as `theindex.html'.

   The file will be created when first publishing a project with the
`:makeindex' set.  The file only contains a statement `#+INCLUDE:
"theindex.inc"'.  You can then build around this include statement by
adding a title, style information, etc.


File: org,  Node: Uploading files,  Next: Sample configuration,  Prev: Configuration,  Up: Publishing

13.2 Uploading files
====================

For those people already utilizing third party sync tools such as
`rsync' or `unison', it might be preferable not to use the built in
remote publishing facilities of Org mode which rely heavily on Tramp.
Tramp, while very useful and powerful, tends not to be so efficient for
multiple file transfer and has been known to cause problems under heavy
usage.

   Specialized synchronization utilities offer several advantages.  In
addition to timestamp comparison, they also do content and
permissions/attribute checks.  For this reason you might prefer to
publish your web to a local directory (possibly even in place with your
Org files) and then use `unison' or `rsync' to do the synchronization
with the remote host.

   Since Unison (for example) can be configured as to which files to
transfer to a certain remote destination, it can greatly simplify the
project publishing definition.  Simply keep all files in the correct
location, process your Org files with `org-publish' and let the
synchronization tool do the rest.  You do not need, in this scenario,
to include attachments such as `jpg', `css' or `gif' files in the
project definition since the 3rd party tool syncs them.

   Publishing to a local directory is also much faster than to a remote
one, so that you can afford more easily to republish entire projects.
If you set `org-publish-use-timestamps-flag' to `nil', you gain the main
benefit of re-including any changed external files such as source
example files you might include with `#+INCLUDE:'.  The timestamp
mechanism in Org is not smart enough to detect if included files have
been modified.

13.3 Sample configuration
=========================

Below we provide two example configurations.  The first one is a simple
project publishing only a set of Org files.  The second example is more
complex, with a multi-component project.

* Menu:

* Simple example::              One-component publishing

File: org,  Node: Simple example,  Next: Complex example,  Prev: Sample configuration,  Up: Sample configuration

13.3.1 Example: simple publishing configuration
-----------------------------------------------

This example publishes a set of Org files to the `public_html'
directory on the local machine.

     (setq org-publish-project-alist
           '(("org"
              :base-directory "~/org/"
              :publishing-directory "~/public_html"
              :section-numbers nil
              :with-toc nil
              :html-head "<link rel=\"stylesheet\"
                         href=\"../other/mystyle.css\"
                         type=\"text/css\"/>")))


File: org,  Node: Complex example,  Prev: Simple example,  Up: Sample configuration

13.3.2 Example: complex publishing configuration
------------------------------------------------

This more complicated example publishes an entire website, including
Org files converted to HTML, image files, Emacs Lisp source code, and
style sheets.  The publishing directory is remote and private files are
excluded.

   To ensure that links are preserved, care should be taken to replicate
your directory structure on the web server, and to use relative file
paths.  For example, if your Org files are kept in `~/org' and your
publishable images in `~/images', you would link to an image with
     file:../images/myimage.png
   On the web server, the relative path to the image should be the
same.  You can accomplish this by setting up an "images" folder in the
right place on the web server, and publishing images to it.

     (setq org-publish-project-alist
           '(("orgfiles"
               :base-directory "~/org/"
               :base-extension "org"
               :publishing-directory "/ssh:user@host:~/html/notebook/"
               :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html
               :exclude "PrivatePage.org"   ;; regexp
               :headline-levels 3
               :section-numbers nil
               :with-toc nil
               :html-head "<link rel=\"stylesheet\"
                       href=\"../other/mystyle.css\" type=\"text/css\"/>"
               :html-preamble t)

              ("images"
               :base-directory "~/images/"
               :base-extension "jpg\\|gif\\|png"
               :publishing-directory "/ssh:user@host:~/html/images/"
               :publishing-function org-publish-attachment)

              ("other"
               :base-directory "~/other/"
               :base-extension "css\\|el"
               :publishing-directory "/ssh:user@host:~/html/other/"
               :publishing-function org-publish-attachment)
              ("website" :components ("orgfiles" "images" "other"))))


File: org,  Node: Triggering publication,  Prev: Sample configuration,  Up: Publishing

13.4 Triggering publication
===========================

Once properly configured, Org can publish with the following commands:

`C-c C-e P x     (`org-publish')'
     Prompt for a specific project and publish all files that belong to
     it.  

`C-c C-e P p     (`org-publish-current-project')'
     Publish the project containing the current file.  

`C-c C-e P f     (`org-publish-current-file')'
     Publish only the current file.  

`C-c C-e P a     (`org-publish-all')'
     Publish every project.

   Org uses timestamps to track when a file has changed.  The above
functions normally only publish changed files.  You can override this
and force publishing of all files by giving a prefix argument to any of
the commands above, or by customizing the variable
`org-publish-use-timestamps-flag'.  This may be necessary in particular
if files include other files via `#+SETUPFILE:' or `#+INCLUDE:'.


File: org,  Node: Working With Source Code,  Next: Miscellaneous,  Prev: Publishing,  Up: Top

14 Working with source code
***************************

Source code can be included in Org mode documents using a `src' block,
e.g.:

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (defun org-xor (a b)
          "Exclusive or."
          (if a (not b) b))
     #+END_SRC

   Org mode provides a number of features for working with live source
code, including editing of code blocks in their native major-mode,
evaluation of code blocks, converting code blocks into source files
(known as "tangling" in literate programming), and exporting code
blocks and their results in several formats.  This functionality was
contributed by Eric Schulte and Dan Davison, and was originally named
Org-babel.

   The following sections describe Org mode's code block handling
facilities.

File: org,  Node: Structure of code blocks,  Next: Editing source code,  Prev: Working With Source Code,  Up: Working With Source Code

14.1 Structure of code blocks
=============================

Live code blocks can be specified with a `src' block or inline.(1)  The
structure of a `src' block is

     #+NAME: <name>
     #+BEGIN_SRC <language> <switches> <header arguments>
       <body>
     #+END_SRC

   The `#+NAME:' line is optional, and can be used to name the code
block.  Live code blocks require that a language be specified on the
`#+BEGIN_SRC' line.  Switches and header arguments are optional.  

   Live code blocks can also be specified inline using

     src_<language>{<body>}

   or

     src_<language>[<header arguments>]{<body>}

`<#+NAME: name>'
     This line associates a name with the code block.  This is similar
     to the `#+NAME: Name' lines that can be used to name tables in Org
     mode files.  Referencing the name of a code block makes it
     possible to evaluate the block from other places in the file, from
     other files, or from Org mode table formulas (see *note The
     spreadsheet::).  Names are assumed to be unique and the behavior
     of Org mode when two or more blocks share the same name is
     undefined.  

`<language>'
     The language of the code in the block (see *note Languages::).  

`<switches>'
     Optional switches control code block export (see the discussion of
     switches in *note Literal examples::) 

`<header arguments>'
     Optional header arguments control many aspects of evaluation,
     export and tangling of code blocks (see *note Header arguments::).
     Header arguments can also be set on a per-buffer or per-subtree
     basis using properties.

`source code, header arguments'

`<body>'
     Source code in the specified language.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that `src' blocks may be inserted using Org mode's *note
Easy Templates:: system


File: org,  Node: Editing source code,  Next: Exporting code blocks,  Prev: Structure of code blocks,  Up: Working With Source Code

14.2 Editing source code
========================

Use `C-c '' to edit the current code block.  This brings up a language
major-mode edit buffer containing the body of the code block.  Manually
saving this buffer with <C-x C-s> will write the contents back to the
Org buffer.  You can also set `org-edit-src-auto-save-idle-delay' to
save the base buffer after some idle delay, or
`org-edit-src-turn-on-auto-save' to auto-save this buffer into a
separate file using `auto-save-mode'.  Use `C-c '' again to exit.

   The `org-src-mode' minor mode will be active in the edit buffer.  The
following variables can be used to configure the behavior of the edit
buffer.  See also the customization group `org-edit-structure' for
further configuration options.

`org-src-lang-modes'
     If an Emacs major-mode named `<lang>-mode' exists, where `<lang>'
     is the language named in the header line of the code block, then
     the edit buffer will be placed in that major-mode.  This variable
     can be used to map arbitrary language names to existing major
     modes.

`org-src-window-setup'
     Controls the way Emacs windows are rearranged when the edit buffer
     is created.

`org-src-preserve-indentation'
     This variable is especially useful for tangling languages such as
     Python, in which whitespace indentation in the output is critical.

`org-src-ask-before-returning-to-edit-buffer'
     By default, Org will ask before returning to an open edit buffer.
     Set this variable to `nil' to switch without asking.

   To turn on native code fontification in the _Org_ buffer, configure
the variable `org-src-fontify-natively'.


File: org,  Node: Exporting code blocks,  Next: Extracting source code,  Prev: Editing source code,  Up: Working With Source Code

14.3 Exporting code blocks
==========================

It is possible to export the _code_ of code blocks, the _results_ of
code block evaluation, _both_ the code and the results of code block
evaluation, or _none_.  For most languages, the default exports code.
However, for some languages (e.g., `ditaa') the default exports the
results of code block evaluation.  For information on exporting code
block bodies, see *note Literal examples::.

   The `:exports' header argument can be used to specify export
behavior:

Header arguments:
.................

`:exports code'
     The default in most languages.  The body of the code block is
     exported, as described in *note Literal examples::.

`:exports results'
     The code block will be evaluated and the results will be placed in
     the Org mode buffer for export, either updating previous results
     of the code block located anywhere in the buffer or, if no
     previous results exist, placing the results immediately after the
     code block.  The body of the code block will not be exported.

`:exports both'
     Both the code block and its results will be exported.

`:exports none'
     Neither the code block nor its results will be exported.

   It is possible to inhibit the evaluation of code blocks during
export.  Setting the `org-export-babel-evaluate' variable to `nil' will
ensure that no code blocks are evaluated as part of the export process.
This can be useful in situations where potentially untrusted Org mode
files are exported in an automated fashion, for example when Org mode
is used as the markup language for a wiki.  It is also possible to set
this variable to `'inline-only'.  In that case, only inline code blocks
will be evaluated, in order to insert their results.  Non-inline code
blocks are assumed to have their results already inserted in the buffer
by manual evaluation.  This setting is useful to avoid expensive
recalculations during export, not to provide security.


File: org,  Node: Extracting source code,  Next: Evaluating code blocks,  Prev: Exporting code blocks,  Up: Working With Source Code

14.4 Extracting source code
===========================

Creating pure source code files by extracting code from source blocks is
referred to as "tangling"--a term adopted from the literate programming
community.  During "tangling" of code blocks their bodies are expanded
using `org-babel-expand-src-block' which can expand both variable and
"noweb" style references  (see *note Noweb reference syntax::).

Header arguments
................

`:tangle no'
     The default.  The code block is not included in the tangled output.

`:tangle yes'
     Include the code block in the tangled output.  The output file
     name is the name of the org file with the extension `.org'
     replaced by the extension for the block language.

`:tangle filename'
     Include the code block in the tangled output to file `filename'.

Functions
.........

`org-babel-tangle'
     Tangle the current file.  Bound to `C-c C-v t'.

     With prefix argument only tangle the current code block.

`org-babel-tangle-file'
     Choose a file to tangle.  Bound to `C-c C-v f'.

Hooks
.....

`org-babel-post-tangle-hook'
     This hook is run from within code files tangled by
     `org-babel-tangle'.  Example applications could include
     post-processing, compilation or evaluation of tangled code files.

Jumping between code and Org
............................

When tangling code from an Org-mode buffer to a source code file, you'll
frequently find yourself viewing the file of tangled source code (e.g.,
many debuggers point to lines of the source code file).  It is useful
to be able to navigate from the tangled source to the Org-mode buffer
from which the code originated.

   The `org-babel-tangle-jump-to-org' function provides this jumping
from code to Org-mode functionality.  Two header arguments are required
for jumping to work, first the `padline' (*note padline::) option must
be set to true (the default setting), second the `comments' (*note
comments::) header argument must be set to `links', which will insert
comments into the source code buffer which point back to the original
Org-mode file.


File: org,  Node: Evaluating code blocks,  Next: Library of Babel,  Prev: Extracting source code,  Up: Working With Source Code

14.5 Evaluating code blocks
===========================

Code blocks can be evaluated(1) and the results of evaluation
optionally placed in the Org mode buffer.  The results of evaluation
are placed following a line that begins by default with `#+RESULTS' and
optionally a cache identifier and/or the name of the evaluated code
block.  The default value of `#+RESULTS' can be changed with the
customizable variable `org-babel-results-keyword'.

   By default, the evaluation facility is only enabled for Lisp code
blocks specified as `emacs-lisp'.  However, source code blocks in many
languages can be evaluated within Org mode (see *note Languages:: for a
list of supported languages and *note Structure of code blocks:: for
information on the syntax used to define a code block).

   There are a number of ways to evaluate code blocks.  The simplest is
to press `C-c C-c' or `C-c C-v e' with the point on a code block(2).
This will call the `org-babel-execute-src-block' function to evaluate
the block and insert its results into the Org mode buffer.  

   It is also possible to evaluate named code blocks from anywhere in
an Org mode buffer or an Org mode table.  Live code blocks located in
the current Org mode buffer or in the "Library of Babel" (see *note
Library of Babel::) can be executed.  Named code blocks can be executed
with a separate `#+CALL:' line or inline within a block of text.

   The syntax of the `#+CALL:' line is

     #+CALL: <name>(<arguments>)
     #+CALL: <name>[<inside header arguments>](<arguments>) <end header arguments>

   The syntax for inline evaluation of named code blocks is

     ... call_<name>(<arguments>) ...
     ... call_<name>[<inside header arguments>](<arguments>)[<end header arguments>] ...

`<name>'
     The name of the code block to be evaluated (see *note Structure of
     code blocks::).

`<arguments>'
     Arguments specified in this section will be passed to the code
     block.  These arguments use standard function call syntax, rather
     than header argument syntax.  For example, a `#+CALL:' line that
     passes the number four to a code block named `double', which
     declares the header argument `:var n=2', would be written as
     `#+CALL: double(n=4)'.

`<inside header arguments>'
     Inside header arguments are passed through and applied to the
     named code block.  These arguments use header argument syntax
     rather than standard function call syntax.  Inside header
     arguments affect how the code block is evaluated.  For example,
     `[:results output]' will collect the results of everything printed
     to `STDOUT' during execution of the code block.

`<end header arguments>'
     End header arguments are applied to the calling instance and do
     not affect evaluation of the named code block.  They affect how
     the results are incorporated into the Org mode buffer and how the
     call line is exported.  For example, `:results html' will insert
     the results of the call line evaluation in the Org buffer, wrapped
     in a `BEGIN_HTML:' block.

     For more examples of passing header arguments to `#+CALL:' lines
     see *note Header arguments in function calls::.

   (1) Whenever code is evaluated there is a potential for that code to
do harm.  Org mode provides safeguards to ensure that code is only
evaluated after explicit confirmation from the user.  For information
on these safeguards (and on how to disable them) see *note Code
evaluation security::.

   (2) The option `org-babel-no-eval-on-ctrl-c-ctrl-c' can be used to
remove code evaluation from the `C-c C-c' key binding.

14.6 Library of Babel
=====================

The "Library of Babel" consists of code blocks that can be called from
any Org mode file.  Code blocks defined in the "Library of Babel" can
be called remotely as if they were in the current Org mode buffer (see
*note Evaluating code blocks:: for information on the syntax of remote
code block evaluation).

   The central repository of code blocks in the "Library of Babel" is
housed in an Org mode file located in the `contrib' directory of Org
mode.

   Users can add code blocks they believe to be generally useful to
their "Library of Babel."  The code blocks can be stored in any Org
mode file and then loaded into the library with `org-babel-lob-ingest'.

   Code blocks located in any Org mode file can be loaded into the
"Library of Babel" with the `org-babel-lob-ingest' function, bound to
`C-c C-v i'.

   Language-specific documentation is available for some languages.  If
available, it can be found at
`http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages.html'.

   The option `org-babel-load-languages' controls which languages are
enabled for evaluation (by default only `emacs-lisp' is enabled).  This
variable can be set using the customization interface or by adding code
like the following to your emacs configuration.

     The following disables `emacs-lisp' evaluation and enables
     evaluation of `R' code blocks.

     (org-babel-do-load-languages
      'org-babel-load-languages
      '((emacs-lisp . nil)
        (R . t)))

   It is also possible to enable support for a language by loading the
related elisp file with `require'.

     The following adds support for evaluating `clojure' code blocks.

     (require 'ob-clojure)

14.8 Header arguments
=====================

Code block functionality can be configured with header arguments.  This
section provides an overview of the use of header arguments, and then
describes each header argument in detail.

14.8.1 Using header arguments
-----------------------------

The values of header arguments can be set in several way.  When the
header arguments in each layer have been determined, they are combined
in order from the first, least specific (having the lowest priority) up
to the last, most specific (having the highest priority).  A header
argument with a higher priority replaces the same header argument
specified at lower priority.

* System-wide header arguments::  Set global default values
* Language-specific header arguments::  Set default values by language
* Header arguments in Org mode properties::  Set default values for a buffer or heading
* Language-specific header arguments in Org mode properties::  Set language-specific default values for a buffer or heading
* Code block specific header arguments::  The most common way to set values
* Header arguments in function calls::  The most specific level


File: org,  Node: System-wide header arguments,  Next: Language-specific header arguments,  Prev: Using header arguments,  Up: Using header arguments

System-wide header arguments
............................

System-wide values of header arguments can be specified by adapting the
`org-babel-default-header-args' variable:

     :session    => "none"
     :results    => "replace"
     :exports    => "code"
     :cache      => "no"
     :noweb      => "no"

   For example, the following example could be used to set the default
value of `:noweb' header arguments to `yes'.  This would have the
effect of expanding `:noweb' references by default when evaluating
source code blocks.

     (setq org-babel-default-header-args
           (cons '(:noweb . "yes")
                 (assq-delete-all :noweb org-babel-default-header-args)))


File: org,  Node: Language-specific header arguments,  Next: Header arguments in Org mode properties,  Prev: System-wide header arguments,  Up: Using header arguments

Language-specific header arguments
..................................

Each language can define its own set of default header arguments in
variable `org-babel-default-header-args:<lang>', where `<lang>' is the
name of the language.  See the language-specific documentation
available online at `http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel'.


File: org,  Node: Header arguments in Org mode properties,  Next: Language-specific header arguments in Org mode properties,  Prev: Language-specific header arguments,  Up: Using header arguments

Header arguments in Org mode properties
.......................................

Buffer-wide header arguments may be specified as properties through the
use of `#+PROPERTY:' lines placed anywhere in an Org mode file (see
*note Property syntax::).

   For example the following would set `session' to `*R*' (only for R
code blocks), and `results' to `silent' for every code block in the
buffer, ensuring that all execution took place in the same session, and
no results would be inserted into the buffer.

     #+PROPERTY: header-args:R  :session *R*
     #+PROPERTY: header-args    :results silent

   Header arguments read from Org mode properties can also be set on a
per-subtree basis using property drawers (see *note Property syntax::).  When
properties are used to set default header arguments, they are always
looked up with inheritance, regardless of the value of
`org-use-property-inheritance'.  Properties are evaluated as seen by the
outermost call or source block.(1)

   In the following example the value of the `:cache' header argument
will default to `yes' in all code blocks in the subtree rooted at the
following heading:

     * outline header
       :PROPERTIES:
       :header-args:    :cache yes
       :END:

   Properties defined in this way override the properties set in
`org-babel-default-header-args' and are applied for all activated
languages.  It is convenient to use the `org-set-property' function
bound to `C-c C-x p' to set properties in Org mode documents.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The deprecated syntax for default header argument properties,
using the name of the header argument as a property name directly,
evaluates the property as seen by the corresponding source block
definition.  This behavior has been kept for backwards compatibility.


File: org,  Node: Language-specific header arguments in Org mode properties,  Next: Code block specific header arguments,  Prev: Header arguments in Org mode properties,  Up: Using header arguments

Language-specific header arguments in Org mode properties
.........................................................

Language-specific header arguments are also read from properties
`header-args:<lang>' where `<lang>' is the name of the language
targeted.  As an example

     * Heading
       :PROPERTIES:
       :header-args:clojure:    :session *clojure-1*
       :header-args:R:          :session *R*
       :END:
     ** Subheading
       :PROPERTIES:
       :header-args:clojure:    :session *clojure-2*
       :END:

   would independently set a default session header argument for R and
clojure for calls and source blocks under subtree "Heading" and change
to a different clojure setting for evaluations under subtree
"Subheading", while the R session is inherited from "Heading" and
therefore unchanged.

Code block specific header arguments
....................................

The most common way to assign values to header arguments is at the code
block level.  This can be done by listing a sequence of header
arguments and their values as part of the `#+BEGIN_SRC' line.
Properties set in this way override both the values of
`org-babel-default-header-args' and header arguments specified as
properties.  In the following example, the `:results' header argument
is set to `silent', meaning the results of execution will not be
inserted in the buffer, and the `:exports' header argument is set to
`code', meaning only the body of the code block will be preserved on
export to HTML or LaTeX.

     #+NAME: factorial
     #+BEGIN_SRC haskell :results silent :exports code :var n=0
     fac 0 = 1
     fac n = n * fac (n-1)
     #+END_SRC
   Similarly, it is possible to set header arguments for inline code
blocks

     src_haskell[:exports both]{fac 5}

   Code block header arguments can span multiple lines using
`#+HEADER:' or `#+HEADERS:' lines preceding a code block or nested
between the `#+NAME:' line and the `#+BEGIN_SRC' line of a named code
block.  

   Multi-line header arguments on an un-named code block:

      #+HEADERS: :var data1=1
      #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var data2=2
        (message "data1:%S, data2:%S" data1 data2)
      #+END_SRC

      #+RESULTS:
      : data1:1, data2:2

   Multi-line header arguments on a named code block:

        #+NAME: named-block
        #+HEADER: :var data=2
        #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
          (message "data:%S" data)
        #+END_SRC

        #+RESULTS: named-block
        : data:2


File: org,  Node: Header arguments in function calls,  Prev: Code block specific header arguments,  Up: Using header arguments

Header arguments in function calls
..................................

At the most specific level, header arguments for "Library of Babel" or
`#+CALL:' lines can be set as shown in the two examples below.  For more
information on the structure of `#+CALL:' lines see *note Evaluating
code blocks::.

   The following will apply the `:exports results' header argument to
the evaluation of the `#+CALL:' line.

     #+CALL: factorial(n=5) :exports results

   The following will apply the `:session special' header argument to
the evaluation of the `factorial' code block.

     #+CALL: factorial[:session special](n=5)

basis, see *note Languages::.


File: org,  Node: var,  Next: results,  Prev: Specific header arguments,  Up: Specific header arguments

14.8.2.1 `:var'
...............

The `:var' header argument is used to pass arguments to code blocks.
The specifics of how arguments are included in a code block vary by
language; these are addressed in the language-specific documentation.
However, the syntax used to specify arguments is the same across all
languages.  In every case, variables require a default value when they
are declared.

   The values passed to arguments can either be literal values,
references, or Emacs Lisp code (see *note Emacs Lisp evaluation of
variables: var.).  References include anything in the Org mode file
that takes a `#+NAME:' or `#+RESULTS:' line: tables, lists,
`#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE' blocks, other code blocks and the results of other
code blocks.

   Note: When a reference is made to another code block, the referenced
block will be evaluated unless it has current cached results (see *note
cache::).

   Argument values can be indexed in a manner similar to arrays (see
*note Indexable variable values: var.).

   The following syntax is used to pass arguments to code blocks using
the `:var' header argument.

     :var name=assign

   The argument, `assign', can either be a literal value, such as a
string `"string"' or a number `9', or a reference to a table, a list, a
literal example, another code block (with or without arguments), or the
results of evaluating another code block.

   Here are examples of passing values by reference:

"table"
     an Org mode table named with either a `#+NAME:' line

          #+NAME: example-table
          | 1 |
          | 2 |
          | 3 |
          | 4 |

          #+NAME: table-length
          #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var table=example-table
          (length table)
          #+END_SRC

          #+RESULTS: table-length
          : 4

"list"
     a simple list named with a `#+NAME:' line (note that nesting is not
     carried through to the source code block)

          #+NAME: example-list
            - simple
              - not
              - nested
            - list

          #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var x=example-list
            (print x)
          #+END_SRC

          #+RESULTS:
          | simple | list |

"code block without arguments"
     a code block name (from the example above), as assigned by
     `#+NAME:', optionally followed by parentheses

          #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var length=table-length()
          (* 2 length)
          #+END_SRC

          #+RESULTS:
          : 8

"code block with arguments"
     a code block name, as assigned by `#+NAME:', followed by
     parentheses and optional arguments passed within the parentheses
     following the code block name using standard function call syntax

          #+NAME: double
          #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var input=8
          (* 2 input)
          #+END_SRC

          #+RESULTS: double
          : 16

          #+NAME: squared
          #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var input=double(input=1)
          (* input input)
          #+END_SRC

          #+RESULTS: squared
          : 4

"literal example"
     a literal example block named with a `#+NAME:' line

          #+NAME: literal-example
          #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
          A literal example
          on two lines
          #+END_EXAMPLE

          #+NAME: read-literal-example
          #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var x=literal-example
            (concatenate 'string x " for you.")
          #+END_SRC

          #+RESULTS: read-literal-example
          : A literal example
          : on two lines for you.


Indexable variable values
.........................

It is possible to reference portions of variable values by "indexing"
into the variables.  Indexes are 0 based with negative values counting
back from the end.  If an index is separated by `,'s then each
subsequent section will index into the next deepest nesting or
dimension of the value.  Note that this indexing occurs _before_ other
table related header arguments like `:hlines', `:colnames' and
`:rownames' are applied.  The following example assigns the last cell
of the first row the table `example-table' to the variable `data':

     #+NAME: example-table
     | 1 | a |
     | 2 | b |
     | 3 | c |
     | 4 | d |

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var data=example-table[0,-1]
       data
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS:
     : a

   Ranges of variable values can be referenced using two integers
separated by a `:', in which case the entire inclusive range is
referenced.  For example the following assigns the middle three rows of
`example-table' to `data'.

     #+NAME: example-table
     | 1 | a |
     | 2 | b |
     | 3 | c |
     | 4 | d |
     | 5 | 3 |

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var data=example-table[1:3]
       data
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS:
     | 2 | b |
     | 3 | c |
     | 4 | d |

   Additionally, an empty index, or the single character `*', are both
interpreted to mean the entire range and as such are equivalent to
`0:-1', as shown in the following example in which the entire first
column is referenced.

     #+NAME: example-table
     | 1 | a |
     | 2 | b |
     | 3 | c |

   It is possible to index into the results of code blocks as well as
tables.  Any number of dimensions can be indexed.  Dimensions are
separated from one another by commas, as shown in the following example.

     #+NAME: 3D
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       '(((1  2  3)  (4  5  6)  (7  8  9))

Emacs Lisp evaluation of variables
..................................

Emacs lisp code can be used to initialize variable values.  When a
variable value starts with `(', `[', `'' or ``' it will be evaluated as
Emacs Lisp and the result of the evaluation will be assigned as the
variable value.  The following example demonstrates use of this
evaluation to reliably pass the file-name of the Org mode buffer to a
code block--note that evaluation of header arguments is guaranteed to
take place in the original Org mode file, while there is no such
guarantee for evaluation of the code block body.

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh :var filename=(buffer-file-name) :exports both
       wc -w $filename
     #+END_SRC

   Note that values read from tables and lists will not be evaluated as
Emacs Lisp, as shown in the following example.

     #+NAME: table
     | (a b c) |

     #+HEADERS: :var data=table[0,0]
     #+BEGIN_SRC perl
       $data
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS:
     : (a b c)

14.8.2.2 `:results'
...................

There are four classes of `:results' header argument.  Only one option
per class may be supplied per code block.

   * collection header arguments specify how the results should be
     collected from the code block

   * type header arguments specify what type of result the code block
     will return--which has implications for how they will be processed
     before insertion into the Org mode buffer

   * format header arguments specify what type of result the code block
     will return--which has implications for how they will be inserted
     into the Org mode buffer

   * handling header arguments specify how the results of evaluating
     the code block should be handled.

Collection
..........

The following options are mutually exclusive, and specify how the
results should be collected from the code block.

   * `value' This is the default.  The result is the value of the last
     statement in the code block.  This header argument places the
     evaluation in functional mode.  Note that in some languages, e.g.,
     Python, use of this result type requires that a `return' statement
     be included in the body of the source code block.  E.g., `:results
     value'.

   * `output' The result is the collection of everything printed to
     STDOUT during the execution of the code block.  This header
     argument places the evaluation in scripting mode.  E.g., `:results
     output'.

Type
....

The following options are mutually exclusive and specify what type of
results the code block will return.  By default, results are inserted
as either a table or scalar depending on their value.

   * `table', `vector' The results should be interpreted as an Org mode
     table.  If a single value is returned, it will be converted into a
     table with one row and one column.  E.g., `:results value table'.

   * `list' The results should be interpreted as an Org mode list.  If
     a single scalar value is returned it will be converted into a list
     with only one element.

   * `scalar', `verbatim' The results should be interpreted
     literally--they will not be converted into a table.  The results
     will be inserted into the Org mode buffer as quoted text.  E.g.,
     `:results value verbatim'.

   * `file' The results will be interpreted as the path to a file, and
     will be inserted into the Org mode buffer as a file link.  E.g.,
     `:results value file'.

Format
......

The following options are mutually exclusive and specify what type of
results the code block will return.  By default, results are inserted
according to the type as specified above.

   * `raw' The results are interpreted as raw Org mode code and are
     inserted directly into the buffer.  If the results look like a
     table they will be aligned as such by Org mode.  E.g., `:results
     value raw'.

   * `org' The results are will be enclosed in a `BEGIN_SRC org' block.
     They are not comma-escaped by default but they will be if you hit
     `TAB' in the block and/or if you export the file.  E.g., `:results
     value org'.

   * `html' Results are assumed to be HTML and will be enclosed in a
     `BEGIN_HTML' block.  E.g., `:results value html'.

   * `latex' Results assumed to be LaTeX and are enclosed in a
     `BEGIN_LaTeX' block.  E.g., `:results value latex'.

   * `code' Result are assumed to be parsable code and are enclosed in
     a code block.  E.g., `:results value code'.

   * `pp' The result is converted to pretty-printed code and is
     enclosed in a code block.  This option currently supports Emacs
     Lisp, Python, and Ruby.  E.g., `:results value pp'.

   * `drawer' The result is wrapped in a RESULTS drawer.  This can be
     useful for inserting `raw' or `org' syntax results in such a way
     that their extent is known and they can be automatically removed
     or replaced.

Handling
........

The following results options indicate what happens with the results
once they are collected.

   * `silent' The results will be echoed in the minibuffer but will not
     be inserted into the Org mode buffer.  E.g., `:results output
     silent'.

   * `replace' The default value.  Any existing results will be
     removed, and the new results will be inserted into the Org mode
     buffer in their place.  E.g., `:results output replace'.

   * `append' If there are pre-existing results of the code block then
     the new results will be appended to the existing results.
     Otherwise the new results will be inserted as with `replace'.

   * `prepend' If there are pre-existing results of the code block then
     the new results will be prepended to the existing results.
     Otherwise the new results will be inserted as with `replace'.


File: org,  Node: file,  Next: file-desc,  Prev: results,  Up: Specific header arguments

14.8.2.3 `:file'
................

The header argument `:file' is used to specify an external file in which
to save code block results.  After code block evaluation an Org mode
style `[[file:]]' link (see *note Link format::) to the file will be
inserted into the Org mode buffer.  Some languages including R,
gnuplot, dot, and ditaa provide special handling of the `:file' header
argument automatically wrapping the code block body in the boilerplate
code required to save output to the specified file.  This is often
useful for saving graphical output of a code block to the specified
file.

   The argument to `:file' should be either a string specifying the
path to a file, or a list of two strings in which case the first
element of the list should be the path to a file and the second a
description for the link.


File: org,  Node: file-desc,  Next: dir,  Prev: file,  Up: Specific header arguments

14.8.2.4 `:file-desc'
.....................

The value of the `:file-desc' header argument is used to provide a
description for file code block results which are inserted as Org mode
links (see *note Link format::).  If the `:file-desc' header argument
is given with no value the link path will be placed in both the "link"
and the "description" portion of the Org mode link.


File: org,  Node: dir,  Next: exports,  Prev: file-desc,  Up: Specific header arguments

14.8.2.5 `:dir' and remote execution
....................................

While the `:file' header argument can be used to specify the path to the
output file, `:dir' specifies the default directory during code block
execution.  If it is absent, then the directory associated with the
current buffer is used.  In other words, supplying `:dir path'
temporarily has the same effect as changing the current directory with
`M-x cd path RET', and then not supplying `:dir'.  Under the surface,
`:dir' simply sets the value of the Emacs variable `default-directory'.

   When using `:dir', you should supply a relative path for file output
(e.g., `:file myfile.jpg' or `:file results/myfile.jpg') in which case
that path will be interpreted relative to the default directory.

   In other words, if you want your plot to go into a folder called
`Work' in your home directory, you could use

     #+BEGIN_SRC R :file myplot.png :dir ~/Work
     matplot(matrix(rnorm(100), 10), type="l")
     #+END_SRC

Remote execution
................

A directory on a remote machine can be specified using tramp file
syntax, in which case the code will be evaluated on the remote machine.
An example is

     #+BEGIN_SRC R :file plot.png :dir /dand@yakuba.princeton.edu:
     plot(1:10, main=system("hostname", intern=TRUE))
     #+END_SRC

   Text results will be returned to the local Org mode buffer as usual,
and file output will be created on the remote machine with relative
paths interpreted relative to the remote directory.  An Org mode link
to the remote file will be created.

   So, in the above example a plot will be created on the remote
machine, and a link of the following form will be inserted in the org
buffer:

     [[file:/scp:dand@yakuba.princeton.edu:/home/dand/plot.png][plot.png]]

   Most of this functionality follows immediately from the fact that
`:dir' sets the value of the Emacs variable `default-directory', thanks
to tramp.  Those using XEmacs, or GNU Emacs prior to version 23 may
need to install tramp separately in order for these features to work
correctly.

Further points
..............

   * If `:dir' is used in conjunction with `:session', although it will
     determine the starting directory for a new session as expected, no
     attempt is currently made to alter the directory associated with
     an existing session.

   * `:dir' should typically not be used to create files during export
     with `:exports results' or `:exports both'.  The reason is that,
     in order to retain portability of exported material between
     machines, during export links inserted into the buffer will _not_
     be expanded against `default directory'.  Therefore, if
     `default-directory' is altered using `:dir', it is probable that
     the file will be created in a location to which the link does not
     point.


File: org,  Node: exports,  Next: tangle,  Prev: dir,  Up: Specific header arguments

14.8.2.6 `:exports'
...................

The `:exports' header argument specifies what should be included in HTML
or LaTeX exports of the Org mode file.

   * `code' The default.  The body of code is included into the
     exported file.  E.g., `:exports code'.

   * `results' The result of evaluating the code is included in the
     exported file.  E.g., `:exports results'.

   * `both' Both the code and results are included in the exported
     file.  E.g., `:exports both'.

   * `none' Nothing is included in the exported file.  E.g., `:exports
     none'.


File: org,  Node: tangle,  Next: mkdirp,  Prev: exports,  Up: Specific header arguments

14.8.2.7 `:tangle'
..................

The `:tangle' header argument specifies whether or not the code block
should be included in tangled extraction of source code files.

   * `tangle' The code block is exported to a source code file named
     after the full path (including the directory) and file name (w/o
     extension) of the Org mode file.  E.g., `:tangle yes'.

   * `no' The default.  The code block is not exported to a source code
     file.  E.g., `:tangle no'.

   * other Any other string passed to the `:tangle' header argument is
     interpreted as a path (directory and file name relative to the
     directory of the Org mode file) to which the block will be
     exported.  E.g., `:tangle path'.


File: org,  Node: mkdirp,  Next: comments,  Prev: tangle,  Up: Specific header arguments

14.8.2.8 `:mkdirp'
..................

The `:mkdirp' header argument can be used to create parent directories
of tangled files when missing.  This can be set to `yes' to enable
directory creation or to `no' to inhibit directory creation.


File: org,  Node: comments,  Next: padline,  Prev: mkdirp,  Up: Specific header arguments

14.8.2.9 `:comments'
....................

By default code blocks are tangled to source-code files without any
insertion of comments beyond those which may already exist in the body
of the code block.  The `:comments' header argument can be set as
follows to control the insertion of extra comments into the tangled
code file.

   * `no' The default.  No extra comments are inserted during tangling.

   * `link' The code block is wrapped in comments which contain
     pointers back to the original Org file from which the code was
     tangled.

   * `yes' A synonym for "link" to maintain backwards compatibility.

   * `org' Include text from the Org mode file as a comment.  The text
     is picked from the leading context of the tangled code and is
     limited by the nearest headline or source block as the case may be.

   * `both' Turns on both the "link" and "org" comment options.

   * `noweb' Turns on the "link" comment option, and additionally wraps
     expanded noweb references in the code block body in link comments.


File: org,  Node: padline,  Next: no-expand,  Prev: comments,  Up: Specific header arguments

14.8.2.10 `:padline'
....................

Control in insertion of padding lines around code block bodies in
tangled code files.  The default value is `yes' which results in
insertion of newlines before and after each tangled code block.  The
following arguments are accepted.

   * `yes' Insert newlines before and after each code block body in
     tangled code files.

   * `no' Do not insert any newline padding in tangled output.


File: org,  Node: no-expand,  Next: session,  Prev: padline,  Up: Specific header arguments

14.8.2.11 `:no-expand'
......................

By default, code blocks are expanded with `org-babel-expand-src-block'
during tangling.  This has the effect of assigning values to variables
specified with `:var' (see *note var::), and of replacing "noweb"
references (see *note Noweb reference syntax::) with their targets.  The
`:no-expand' header argument can be used to turn off this behavior.


File: org,  Node: session,  Next: noweb,  Prev: no-expand,  Up: Specific header arguments

14.8.2.12 `:session'
....................

The `:session' header argument starts a session for an interpreted
language where state is preserved.

   By default, a session is not started.

   A string passed to the `:session' header argument will give the
session a name.  This makes it possible to run concurrent sessions for
each interpreted language.


File: org,  Node: noweb,  Next: noweb-ref,  Prev: session,  Up: Specific header arguments

14.8.2.13 `:noweb'
..................

The `:noweb' header argument controls expansion of "noweb" syntax
references (see *note Noweb reference syntax::) when the code block is
evaluated, tangled, or exported.  The `:noweb' header argument can have
one of the five values: `no', `yes', `tangle', or `no-export'
`strip-export'.

   * `no' The default.  "Noweb" syntax references in the body of the
     code block will not be expanded before the code block is
     evaluated, tangled or exported.

   * `yes' "Noweb" syntax references in the body of the code block will
     be expanded before the code block is evaluated, tangled or
     exported.

   * `tangle' "Noweb" syntax references in the body of the code block
     will be expanded before the code block is tangled.  However,
     "noweb" syntax references will not be expanded when the code block
     is evaluated or exported.

   * `no-export' "Noweb" syntax references in the body of the code
     block will be expanded before the block is evaluated or tangled.
     However, "noweb" syntax references will not be expanded when the
     code block is exported.

   * `strip-export' "Noweb" syntax references in the body of the code
     block will be expanded before the block is evaluated or tangled.
     However, "noweb" syntax references will be removed when the code
     block is exported.

   * `eval' "Noweb" syntax references in the body of the code block
     will only be expanded before the block is evaluated.

Noweb prefix lines
..................

Noweb insertions are now placed behind the line prefix of the
`<<reference>>'.  This behavior is illustrated in the following
example.  Because the `<<example>>' noweb reference appears behind the
SQL comment syntax, each line of the expanded noweb reference will be
commented.

   This code block:

     -- <<example>>

   expands to:

     -- this is the
     -- multi-line body of example

   Note that noweb replacement text that does not contain any newlines
will not be affected by this change, so it is still possible to use
inline noweb references.


File: org,  Node: noweb-ref,  Next: noweb-sep,  Prev: noweb,  Up: Specific header arguments

14.8.2.14 `:noweb-ref'
......................

When expanding "noweb" style references the bodies of all code block
with _either_ a block name matching the reference name _or_ a
`:noweb-ref' header argument matching the reference name will be
concatenated together to form the replacement text.

   By setting this header argument at the sub-tree or file level,
simple code block concatenation may be achieved.  For example, when
tangling the following Org mode file, the bodies of code blocks will be
concatenated into the resulting pure code file(1).

      #+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle yes :noweb yes :shebang #!/bin/sh
        <<fullest-disk>>
      #+END_SRC
      * the mount point of the fullest disk
        :PROPERTIES:
        :noweb-ref: fullest-disk
        :END:

      ** query all mounted disks
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        df \
      #+END_SRC

      ** strip the header row
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        |sed '1d' \
      #+END_SRC

      ** sort by the percent full
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        |awk '{print $5 " " $6}'|sort -n |tail -1 \
      #+END_SRC

      ** extract the mount point
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        |awk '{print $2}'
      #+END_SRC

   The `:noweb-sep' (see *note noweb-sep::) header argument holds the
string used to separate accumulate noweb references like those above.
By default a newline is used.

`noweb-ref' property, see *note Property inheritance::).

14.8.2.15 `:noweb-sep'

accumulate noweb references (see *note noweb-ref::).  By default a
newline is used.


File: org,  Node: cache,  Next: sep,  Prev: noweb-sep,  Up: Specific header arguments

14.8.2.16 `:cache'
..................

The `:cache' header argument controls the use of in-buffer caching of
the results of evaluating code blocks.  It can be used to avoid
re-evaluating unchanged code blocks.  Note that the `:cache' header
argument will not attempt to cache results when the `:session' header
argument is used, because the results of the code block execution may
be stored in the session outside of the Org mode buffer.  The `:cache'
header argument can have one of two values: `yes' or `no'.

   * `no' The default.  No caching takes place, and the code block will
     be evaluated every time it is called.

   * `yes' Every time the code block is run a SHA1 hash of the code and
     arguments passed to the block will be generated.  This hash is
     packed into the `#+RESULTS:' line and will be checked on subsequent
     executions of the code block.  If the code block has not changed
     since the last time it was evaluated, it will not be re-evaluated.

   Code block caches notice if the value of a variable argument to the
code block has changed.  If this is the case, the cache is invalidated
and the code block is re-run.  In the following example, `caller' will
not be re-run unless the results of `random' have changed since it was
last run.

      #+NAME: random
      #+BEGIN_SRC R :cache yes
      runif(1)
      #+END_SRC

      #+RESULTS[a2a72cd647ad44515fab62e144796432793d68e1]: random

14.8.2.17 `:sep'
................

The `:sep' header argument can be used to control the delimiter used
when writing tabular results out to files external to Org mode.  This
is used either when opening tabular results of a code block by calling
the `org-open-at-point' function bound to `C-c C-o' on the code block,
or when writing code block results to an external file (see *note
file::) header argument.

   By default, when `:sep' is not specified output tables are tab
delimited.


File: org,  Node: hlines,  Next: colnames,  Prev: sep,  Up: Specific header arguments

14.8.2.18 `:hlines'
...................

Tables are frequently represented with one or more horizontal lines, or
hlines.  The `:hlines' argument to a code block accepts the values
`yes' or `no', with a default value of `no'.

   * `no' Strips horizontal lines from the input table.  In most
     languages this is the desired effect because an `hline' symbol is
     interpreted as an unbound variable and raises an error.  Setting
     `:hlines no' or relying on the default value yields the following
     results.

          #+NAME: many-cols
          | a | b | c |
          |---+---+---|
          | d | e | f |
          |---+---+---|
          | g | h | i |

          #+NAME: echo-table
          #+BEGIN_SRC python :var tab=many-cols
            return tab
          #+END_SRC

          #+RESULTS: echo-table
          | a | b | c |
          | d | e | f |
          | g | h | i |

   * `yes' Leaves hlines in the table.  Setting `:hlines yes' has this
     effect.

          #+NAME: many-cols
          | a | b | c |
          |---+---+---|

14.8.2.19 `:colnames'
.....................

The `:colnames' header argument accepts the values `yes', `no', or
`nil' for unassigned.  The default value is `nil'.  Note that the
behavior of the `:colnames' header argument may differ across languages.

   * `nil' If an input table looks like it has column names (because
     its second row is an hline), then the column names will be removed
     from the table before processing, then reapplied to the results.

          #+NAME: less-cols

     Please note that column names are not removed before the table is
     indexed using variable indexing *Note Indexable variable values:
     var.

   * `no' No column name pre-processing takes place

   * `yes' Column names are removed and reapplied as with `nil' even if
     the table does not "look like" it has column names (i.e., the
     second row is not an hline)

14.8.2.20 `:rownames'
.....................

The `:rownames' header argument can take on the values `yes' or `no',
with a default value of `no'.  Note that Emacs Lisp code blocks ignore
the `:rownames' header argument entirely given the ease with which
tables with row names may be handled directly in Emacs Lisp.

   * `no' No row name pre-processing will take place.

   * `yes' The first column of the table is removed from the table
     before processing, and is then reapplied to the results.

          #+NAME: with-rownames
          | one | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |  5 |
          | two | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |

          #+NAME: echo-table-once-again
          #+BEGIN_SRC python :var tab=with-rownames :rownames yes
            return [[val + 10 for val in row] for row in tab]

          | two | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 |

     Please note that row names are not removed before the table is
     indexed using variable indexing *Note Indexable variable values:
     var.

14.8.2.21 `:shebang'
....................

Setting the `:shebang' header argument to a string value (e.g.,
`:shebang "#!/bin/bash"') causes the string to be inserted as the first
line of any tangled file holding the code block, and the file
permissions of the tangled file are set to make it executable.


File: org,  Node: tangle-mode,  Next: eval,  Prev: shebang,  Up: Specific header arguments

14.8.2.22 `:tangle-mode'
........................

The `tangle-mode' header argument controls the permission set on tangled
files.  The value of this header argument will be passed to
`set-file-modes'.  For example, to set a tangled file as read only use
`:tangle-mode (identity #o444)', or to set a tangled file as executable
use `:tangle-mode (identity #o755)'.  Blocks with `shebang' (*note
shebang::) header arguments will automatically be made executable unless
the `tangle-mode' header argument is also used.  The behavior is
undefined if multiple code blocks with different values for the
`tangle-mode' header argument are tangled to the same file.


File: org,  Node: eval,  Next: wrap,  Prev: tangle-mode,  Up: Specific header arguments

14.8.2.23 `:eval'
.................

The `:eval' header argument can be used to limit the evaluation of
specific code blocks.  The `:eval' header argument can be useful for
protecting against the evaluation of dangerous code blocks or to ensure
that evaluation will require a query regardless of the value of the
`org-confirm-babel-evaluate' variable.  The possible values of `:eval'
and their effects are shown below.

`never or no'
     The code block will not be evaluated under any circumstances.

`query'
     Evaluation of the code block will require a query.

`never-export or no-export'
     The code block will not be evaluated during export but may still
     be called interactively.

`query-export'
     Evaluation of the code block during export will require a query.

   If this header argument is not set then evaluation is determined by
the value of the `org-confirm-babel-evaluate' variable see *note Code
evaluation security::.


File: org,  Node: wrap,  Next: post,  Prev: eval,  Up: Specific header arguments

14.8.2.24 `:wrap'
.................

The `:wrap' header argument is used to mark the results of source block
evaluation.  The header argument can be passed a string that will be
appended to `#+BEGIN_' and `#+END_', which will then be used to wrap the
results.  If not string is specified then the results will be wrapped
in a `#+BEGIN/END_RESULTS' block.


File: org,  Node: post,  Next: prologue,  Prev: wrap,  Up: Specific header arguments

14.8.2.25 `:post'
.................

The `:post' header argument is used to post-process the results of a
code block execution.  When a post argument is given, the results of
the code block will temporarily be bound to the `*this*' variable.
This variable may then be included in header argument forms such as
those used in *note var:: header argument specifications allowing
passing of results to other code blocks, or direct execution via Emacs
Lisp.

   The following example illustrates the usage of the `:post' header
argument.

     #+name: attr_wrap
     #+begin_src sh :var data="" :var width="\\textwidth" :results output
       echo "#+ATTR_LATEX :width $width"
       echo "$data"
     #+end_src

     #+header: :file /tmp/it.png
     #+begin_src dot :post attr_wrap(width="5cm", data=*this*) :results drawer
       digraph{
               a -> b;
               b -> c;
               c -> a;
       }
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     :RESULTS:
     #+ATTR_LATEX :width 5cm

File: org,  Node: prologue,  Next: epilogue,  Prev: post,  Up: Specific header arguments

14.8.2.26 `:prologue'
.....................

The value of the `prologue' header argument will be prepended to the
code block body before execution.  For example, `:prologue "reset"' may
be used to reset a gnuplot session before execution of a particular code
block, or the following configuration may be used to do this for all
gnuplot code blocks.  Also see *note epilogue::.

     (add-to-list 'org-babel-default-header-args:gnuplot

14.9 Results of evaluation
==========================

The way in which results are handled depends on whether a session is
invoked, as well as on whether `:results value' or `:results output' is
used.  The following table shows the table possibilities.  For a full
listing of the possible results header arguments see *note results::.

                    Non-session              Session
`:results value'    value of last            value of last expression
                    expression               
`:results output'   contents of STDOUT       concatenation of interpreter
                                             output

   Note: With `:results value', the result in both `:session' and
non-session is returned to Org mode as a table (a one- or
two-dimensional vector of strings or numbers) when appropriate.

14.9.1 Non-session
------------------

14.9.1.1 `:results value'
.........................

This is the default.  Internally, the value is obtained by wrapping the
code in a function definition in the external language, and evaluating
that function.  Therefore, code should be written as if it were the
body of such a function.  In particular, note that Python does not
automatically return a value from a function unless a `return'
statement is present, and so a `return' statement will usually be
required in Python.

   This is the only one of the four evaluation contexts in which the
code is automatically wrapped in a function definition.

14.9.1.2 `:results output'
..........................

The code is passed to the interpreter as an external process, and the
contents of the standard output stream are returned as text.  (In
certain languages this also contains the error output stream; this is
an area for future work.)

14.9.2 Session
--------------

14.9.2.1 `:results value'
.........................

The code is passed to an interpreter running as an interactive Emacs
inferior process.  Only languages which provide tools for interactive
evaluation of code have session support, so some language (e.g., C and
ditaa) do not support the `:session' header argument, and in other
languages (e.g., Python and Haskell) which have limitations on the code
which may be entered into interactive sessions, those limitations apply
to the code in code blocks using the `:session' header argument as well.

   Unless the `:results output' option is supplied (see below) the
result returned is the result of the last evaluation performed by the
interpreter.  (This is obtained in a language-specific manner: the
value of the variable `_' in Python and Ruby, and the value of
`.Last.value' in R).

14.9.2.2 `:results output'
..........................

The code is passed to the interpreter running as an interactive Emacs
inferior process.  The result returned is the concatenation of the
sequence of (text) output from the interactive interpreter.  Notice
that this is not necessarily the same as what would be sent to `STDOUT'
if the same code were passed to a non-interactive interpreter running
as an external process.  For example, compare the following two blocks:

     #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
      print "hello"
      2
      print "bye"
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS:
     : hello
     : bye

   In non-session mode, the `2' is not printed and does not appear.

     #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session
      print "hello"
      2
      print "bye"
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS:
     : hello
     : 2
     : bye

   But in `:session' mode, the interactive interpreter receives input
`2' and prints out its value, `2'.  (Indeed, the other print statements
are unnecessary here).


File: org,  Node: Noweb reference syntax,  Next: Key bindings and useful functions,  Prev: Results of evaluation,  Up: Working With Source Code

14.10 Noweb reference syntax
============================

The "noweb" (see `http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/') Literate
Programming system allows named blocks of code to be referenced by
using the familiar Noweb syntax:

     <<code-block-name>>

   When a code block is tangled or evaluated, whether or not "noweb"
references are expanded depends upon the value of the `:noweb' header
argument.  If `:noweb yes', then a Noweb reference is expanded before
evaluation.  If `:noweb no', the default, then the reference is not
expanded before evaluation.  See the *note noweb-ref:: header argument
for a more flexible way to resolve noweb references.

   It is possible to include the _results_ of a code block rather than
the body.  This is done by appending parenthesis to the code block name
which may optionally contain arguments to the code block as shown below.

     <<code-block-name(optional arguments)>>

   Note: the default value, `:noweb no', was chosen to ensure that
correct code is not broken in a language, such as Ruby, where `<<arg>>'
is a syntactically valid construct.  If `<<arg>>' is not syntactically
valid in languages that you use, then please consider setting the
default value.

   Note: if noweb tangling is slow in large Org mode files consider
setting the `org-babel-use-quick-and-dirty-noweb-expansion' variable to
`t'.  This will result in faster noweb reference resolution at the
expense of not correctly resolving inherited values of the `:noweb-ref'
header argument.

14.11 Key bindings and useful functions
=======================================

Many common Org mode key sequences are re-bound depending on the
context.

   Within a code block, the following key bindings are active:

`C-c C-c'          `org-babel-execute-src-block'
`C-c C-o'          `org-babel-open-src-block-result'
`C-<up>'           `org-babel-load-in-session'
`M-<down>'         `org-babel-pop-to-session'

15.1 Completion
===============

Emacs would not be Emacs without completion, and Org mode uses it
whenever it makes sense.  If you prefer an iswitchb- or ido-like
interface for some of the completion prompts, you can specify your
preference by setting at most one of the variables
`org-completion-use-iswitchb' `org-completion-use-ido'.

   Org supports in-buffer completion.  This type of completion does not
make use of the minibuffer.  You simply type a few letters into the
buffer and use the key to complete text right there.

`M-<TAB>'
     Complete word at point
        * At the beginning of a headline, complete TODO keywords.

        * After `\', complete TeX symbols supported by the exporter.

        * After `*', complete headlines in the current buffer so that
          they can be used in search links like `[[*find this
          headline]]'.

        * After `:' in a headline, complete tags.  The list of tags is
          taken from the variable `org-tag-alist' (possibly set through
          the `#+TAGS' in-buffer option, *note Setting tags::), or it
          is created dynamically from all tags used in the current
          buffer.

        * After `:' and not in a headline, complete property keys.  The
          list of keys is constructed dynamically from all keys used in
          the current buffer.

        * After `[', complete link abbreviations (*note Link
          abbreviations::).

        * After `#+', complete the special keywords like `TYP_TODO' or
          `OPTIONS' which set file-specific options for Org mode.  When
          the option keyword is already complete, pressing `M-<TAB>'
          again will insert example settings for this keyword.

        * In the line after `#+STARTUP: ', complete startup keywords,
          i.e., valid keys for this line.

        * Elsewhere, complete dictionary words using Ispell.

15.2 Easy Templates
===================

Org mode supports insertion of empty structural elements (like
`#+BEGIN_SRC' and `#+END_SRC' pairs) with just a few key strokes.  This
is achieved through a native template expansion mechanism.  Note that
Emacs has several other template mechanisms which could be used in a
similar way, for example `yasnippet'.

   To insert a structural element, type a `<', followed by a template
selector and `<TAB>'.  Completion takes effect only when the above
keystrokes are typed on a line by itself.

   The following template selectors are currently supported.

`s'     `#+BEGIN_SRC     ... #+END_SRC'
`e'     `#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE ... #+END_EXAMPLE'
`q'     `#+BEGIN_QUOTE   ... #+END_QUOTE'
`v'     `#+BEGIN_VERSE   ... #+END_VERSE'
`c'     `#+BEGIN_CENTER  ... #+END_CENTER'
`l'     `#+BEGIN_LaTeX   ... #+END_LaTeX'
`L'     `#+LaTeX:'
`h'     `#+BEGIN_HTML    ... #+END_HTML'
`H'     `#+HTML:'
`a'     `#+BEGIN_ASCII   ... #+END_ASCII'
`A'     `#+ASCII:'
`i'     `#+INDEX:' line
`I'     `#+INCLUDE:' line

   For example, on an empty line, typing "<e" and then pressing TAB,
will expand into a complete EXAMPLE template.

   You can install additional templates by customizing the variable
`org-structure-template-alist'.  See the docstring of the variable for
additional details.

15.3 Speed keys
===============

Single keys can be made to execute commands when the cursor is at the
beginning of a headline, i.e., before the first star.  Configure the
variable `org-use-speed-commands' to activate this feature.  There is a
pre-defined list of commands, and you can add more such commands using
the variable `org-speed-commands-user'.  Speed keys do not only speed up
navigation and other commands, but they also provide an alternative way
to execute commands bound to keys that are not or not easily available
on a TTY, or on a small mobile device with a limited keyboard.

   To see which commands are available, activate the feature and press
`?' with the cursor at the beginning of a headline.

15.4 Code evaluation and security issues
========================================

Org provides tools to work with the code snippets, including evaluating
them.

   Running code on your machine always comes with a security risk.
Badly written or malicious code can be executed on purpose or by
accident.  Org has default settings which will only evaluate such code
if you give explicit permission to do so, and as a casual user of these
features you should leave these precautions intact.

   For people who regularly work with such code, the confirmation
prompts can become annoying, and you might want to turn them off.  This
can be done, but you must be aware of the risks that are involved.

   Code evaluation can happen under the following circumstances:

Source code blocks
     Source code blocks can be evaluated during export, or when
     pressing `C-c C-c' in the block.  The most important thing to
     realize here is that Org mode files which contain code snippets
     are, in a certain sense, like executable files.  So you should
     accept them and load them into Emacs only from trusted
     sources--just like you would do with a program you install on your
     computer.

     Make sure you know what you are doing before customizing the
     variables which take off the default security brakes.

      -- User Option: org-confirm-babel-evaluate
          When t (the default), the user is asked before every code
          block evaluation.  When `nil', the user is not asked.  When
          set to a function, it is called with two arguments (language
          and body of the code block) and should return t to ask and
          `nil' not to ask.

     For example, here is how to execute "ditaa" code (which is
     considered safe) without asking:

          (defun my-org-confirm-babel-evaluate (lang body)
            (not (string= lang "ditaa")))  ; don't ask for ditaa
          (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate 'my-org-confirm-babel-evaluate)

Following `shell' and `elisp' links
     Org has two link types that can directly evaluate code (*note
     External links::).  These links can be problematic because the
     code to be evaluated is not visible.

      -- User Option: org-confirm-shell-link-function
          Function to queries user about shell link execution.

      -- User Option: org-confirm-elisp-link-function
          Functions to query user for Emacs Lisp link execution.

Formulas in tables
     Formulas in tables (*note The spreadsheet::) are code that is
     evaluated either by the calc interpreter, or by the Emacs Lisp
     interpreter.

15.5 Customization
==================

There are more than 500 variables that can be used to customize Org.
For the sake of compactness of the manual, I am not describing the
variables here.  A structured overview of customization variables is
available with `M-x org-customize RET'.  Or select `Browse Org Group'
from the `Org->Customization' menu.  Many settings can also be
activated on a per-file basis, by putting special lines into the buffer
(*note In-buffer settings::).

15.6 Summary of in-buffer settings
==================================

Org mode uses special lines in the buffer to define settings on a
per-file basis.  These lines start with a `#+' followed by a keyword, a
colon, and then individual words defining a setting.  Several setting
words can be in the same line, but you can also have multiple lines for
the keyword.  While these settings are described throughout the manual,
here is a summary.  After changing any of those lines in the buffer,
press `C-c C-c' with the cursor still in the line to activate the
changes immediately.  Otherwise they become effective only when the
file is visited again in a new Emacs session.

`#+ARCHIVE: %s_done::'
     This line sets the archive location for the agenda file.  It
     applies for all subsequent lines until the next `#+ARCHIVE' line,
     or the end of the file.  The first such line also applies to any
     entries before it.  The corresponding variable is
     `org-archive-location'.

`#+CATEGORY:'
     This line sets the category for the agenda file.  The category
     applies for all subsequent lines until the next `#+CATEGORY' line,
     or the end of the file.  The first such line also applies to any
     entries before it.

`#+COLUMNS: %25ITEM .....'
     Set the default format for columns view.  This format applies when
     columns view is invoked in locations where no `COLUMNS' property
     applies.

`#+CONSTANTS: name1=value1 ...'
     Set file-local values for constants to be used in table formulas.
     This line sets the local variable
     `org-table-formula-constants-local'.  The global version of this
     variable is `org-table-formula-constants'.

`#+FILETAGS: :tag1:tag2:tag3:'
     Set tags that can be inherited by any entry in the file, including
     the top-level entries.

`#+DRAWERS: NAME1 .....'
     Set the file-local set of additional drawers.  The corresponding
     global variable is `org-drawers'.

`#+LINK:  linkword replace'
     These lines (several are allowed) specify link abbreviations.
     *Note Link abbreviations::.  The corresponding variable is
     `org-link-abbrev-alist'.

`#+PRIORITIES: highest lowest default'
     This line sets the limits and the default for the priorities.  All
     three must be either letters A-Z or numbers 0-9.  The highest
     priority must have a lower ASCII number than the lowest priority.

`#+PROPERTY: Property_Name Value'
     This line sets a default inheritance value for entries in the
     current buffer, most useful for specifying the allowed values of a
     property.  

`#+SETUPFILE: file'
     This line defines a file that holds more in-buffer setup.
     Normally this is entirely ignored.  Only when the buffer is parsed
     for option-setting lines (i.e., when starting Org mode for a file,
     when pressing `C-c C-c' in a settings line, or when exporting),
     then the contents of this file are parsed as if they had been
     included in the buffer.  In particular, the file can be any other
     Org mode file with internal setup.  You can visit the file the
     cursor is in the line with `C-c ''.

`#+STARTUP:'
     This line sets options to be used at startup of Org mode, when an
     Org file is being visited.

     The first set of options deals with the initial visibility of the
     outline tree.  The corresponding variable for global default
     settings is `org-startup-folded', with a default value `t', which
     means `overview'.  
          overview         top-level headlines only
          content          all headlines
          showall          no folding of any entries
          showeverything   show even drawer contents

     Dynamic virtual indentation is controlled by the variable
     `org-startup-indented'(1)
          indent     start with `org-indent-mode' turned on
          noindent   start with `org-indent-mode' turned off

     Then there are options for aligning tables upon visiting a file.
     This is useful in files containing narrowed table columns.  The
     corresponding variable is `org-startup-align-all-tables', with a
     default value `nil'.  
          align      align all tables
          noalign    don't align tables on startup

     When visiting a file, inline images can be automatically
     displayed.  The corresponding variable is
     `org-startup-with-inline-images', with a default value `nil' to
     avoid delays when visiting a file.  
          inlineimages   show inline images
          noinlineimages don't show inline images on startup

     When visiting a file, LaTeX fragments can be converted to images
     automatically.  The variable `org-startup-with-latex-preview' which
     controls this behavior, is set to `nil' by default to avoid delays
     on startup.  
          latexpreview   preview LaTeX fragments
          nolatexpreview don't preview LaTeX fragments

     Logging the closing and reopening of TODO items and clock
     intervals can be configured using these options (see variables
     `org-log-done', `org-log-note-clock-out' and `org-log-repeat') 
          logdone             record a timestamp when an item is marked DONE
          lognotedone         record timestamp and a note when DONE
          nologdone           don't record when items are marked DONE
          logrepeat           record a time when reinstating a repeating item
          lognoterepeat       record a note when reinstating a repeating item
          nologrepeat         do not record when reinstating repeating item
          lognoteclock-out    record a note when clocking out
          nolognoteclock-out  don't record a note when clocking out
          logreschedule       record a timestamp when scheduling time changes
          lognotereschedule   record a note when scheduling time changes
          nologreschedule     do not record when a scheduling date changes
          logredeadline       record a timestamp when deadline changes
          lognoteredeadline   record a note when deadline changes
          nologredeadline     do not record when a deadline date changes
          logrefile           record a timestamp when refiling
          lognoterefile       record a note when refiling
          nologrefile         do not record when refiling
          logdrawer           store log into drawer
          nologdrawer         store log outside of drawer
          logstatesreversed   reverse the order of states notes
          nologstatesreversed do not reverse the order of states notes

     Here are the options for hiding leading stars in outline headings,
     and for indenting outlines.  The corresponding variables are
     `org-hide-leading-stars' and `org-odd-levels-only', both with a
     default setting `nil' (meaning `showstars' and `oddeven').  
          hidestars  make all but one of the stars starting a headline invisible.
          showstars  show all stars starting a headline
          indent     virtual indentation according to outline level
          noindent   no virtual indentation according to outline level
          odd        allow only odd outline levels (1,3,...)
          oddeven    allow all outline levels

     To turn on custom format overlays over timestamps (variables
     `org-put-time-stamp-overlays' and
     `org-time-stamp-overlay-formats'), use 
          customtime overlay custom time format

     The following options influence the table spreadsheet (variable
     `constants-unit-system').  
          constcgs   `constants.el' should use the c-g-s unit system
          constSI    `constants.el' should use the SI unit system

     To influence footnote settings, use the following keywords.  The
     corresponding variables are `org-footnote-define-inline',
     `org-footnote-auto-label', and `org-footnote-auto-adjust'.  
          fninline    define footnotes inline
          fnnoinline  define footnotes in separate section
          fnlocal     define footnotes near first reference, but not inline
          fnprompt    prompt for footnote labels
          fnauto      create `[fn:1]'-like labels automatically (default)
          fnconfirm   offer automatic label for editing or confirmation
          fnplain     create `[1]'-like labels automatically
          fnadjust    automatically renumber and sort footnotes
          nofnadjust  do not renumber and sort automatically

     To hide blocks on startup, use these keywords.  The corresponding
     variable is `org-hide-block-startup'.  
          hideblocks   Hide all begin/end blocks on startup
          nohideblocks Do not hide blocks on startup

     The display of entities as UTF-8 characters is governed by the
     variable `org-pretty-entities' and the keywords 
          entitiespretty  Show entities as UTF-8 characters where possible
          entitiesplain   Leave entities plain

`#+TAGS:  TAG1(c1) TAG2(c2)'
     These lines (several such lines are allowed) specify the valid
     tags in this file, and (potentially) the corresponding _fast tag
     selection_ keys.  The corresponding variable is `org-tag-alist'.  

`#+TBLFM:'
     This line contains the formulas for the table directly above the
     line.

     Table can have multiple lines containing `#+TBLFM:'.  Note that
     only the first line of `#+TBLFM:' will be applied when you
     recalculate the table.  For more details see *note Using multiple
     #+TBLFM lines:: in *note Editing and debugging formulas::.

`#+TITLE:, #+AUTHOR:, #+EMAIL:, #+LANGUAGE:, #+DATE:,'
`#+OPTIONS:, #+BIND:,'
`#+DESCRIPTION:, #+KEYWORDS:,'
`#+LaTeX_HEADER:, #+LaTeX_HEADER_EXTRA:,'
`#+HTML_HEAD:, #+HTML_HEAD_EXTRA:, #+HTML_LINK_UP:, #+HTML_LINK_HOME:,'
`#+SELECT_TAGS:, #+EXCLUDE_TAGS:'
     These lines provide settings for exporting files.  For more
     details see *note Export settings::.

`#+TODO:    #+SEQ_TODO:   #+TYP_TODO:'
     These lines set the TODO keywords and their interpretation in the
     current file.  The corresponding variable is `org-todo-keywords'.

15.7 The very busy C-c C-c key
==============================

The key `C-c C-c' has many purposes in Org, which are all mentioned
scattered throughout this manual.  One specific function of this key is
to add _tags_ to a headline (*note Tags::).  In many other
circumstances it means something like _"Hey Org, look here and update
according to what you see here"_.  Here is a summary of what this means
in different contexts.

   - If there are highlights in the buffer from the creation of a sparse
     tree, or from clock display, remove these highlights.

   - If the cursor is in one of the special `#+KEYWORD' lines, this
     triggers scanning the buffer for these lines and updating the
     information.

   - If the cursor is inside a table, realign the table.  This command
     works even if the automatic table editor has been turned off.

   - If the cursor is on a `#+TBLFM' line, re-apply the formulas to the
     entire table.

   - If the current buffer is a capture buffer, close the note and file
     it.  With a prefix argument, file it, without further interaction,
     to the default location.

   - If the cursor is on a `<<<target>>>', update radio targets and
     corresponding links in this buffer.

   - If the cursor is in a property line or at the start or end of a
     property drawer, offer property commands.

   - If the cursor is at a footnote reference, go to the corresponding
     definition, and _vice versa_.

   - If the cursor is on a statistics cookie, update it.

   - If the cursor is in a plain list item with a checkbox, toggle the
     status of the checkbox.

   - If the cursor is on a numbered item in a plain list, renumber the
     ordered list.

   - If the cursor is on the `#+BEGIN' line of a dynamic block, the
     block is updated.

   - If the cursor is at a timestamp, fix the day name in the timestamp.

15.8 A cleaner outline view
===========================

Some people find it noisy and distracting that the Org headlines start
with a potentially large number of stars, and that text below the
headlines is not indented.  While this is no problem when writing a
_book-like_ document where the outline headings are really section
headings, in a more _list-oriented_ outline, indented structure is a
lot cleaner:

     * Top level headline             |    * Top level headline
     ** Second level                  |      * Second level
     *** 3rd level                    |        * 3rd level
     some text                        |          some text
     *** 3rd level                    |        * 3rd level
     more text                        |          more text
     * Another top level headline     |    * Another top level headline

If you are using at least Emacs 23.2(1) and version 6.29 of Org, this
kind of view can be achieved dynamically at display time using
`org-indent-mode'.  In this minor mode, all lines are prefixed for
display with the necessary amount of space(2).  Also headlines are
prefixed with additional stars, so that the amount of indentation
shifts by two(3)  spaces per level.  All headline stars but the last
one are made invisible using the `org-hide' face(4); see below under
`2.' for more information on how this works.  You can turn on
`org-indent-mode' for all files by customizing the variable
`org-startup-indented', or you can turn it on for individual files using

     #+STARTUP: indent

   If you want a similar effect in an earlier version of Emacs and/or
Org, or if you want the indentation to be hard space characters so that
the plain text file looks as similar as possible to the Emacs display,
Org supports you in the following way:

  1. _Indentation of text below headlines_
     You may indent text below each headline to make the left boundary
     line up with the headline, like

          *** 3rd level
              more text, now indented

     Org supports this with paragraph filling, line wrapping, and
     structure editing(5), preserving or adapting the indentation as
     appropriate.

  2. _Hiding leading stars_
     You can modify the display in such a way that all leading stars
     become invisible.  To do this in a global way, configure the
     variable `org-hide-leading-stars' or change this on a per-file
     basis with

          #+STARTUP: hidestars
          #+STARTUP: showstars

     With hidden stars, the tree becomes:

          * Top level headline
           * Second level
            * 3rd level
            ...

     The leading stars are not truly replaced by whitespace, they are
     only fontified with the face `org-hide' that uses the background
     color as font color.  If you are not using either white or black
     background, you may have to customize this face to get the wanted
     effect.  Another possibility is to set this font such that the
     extra stars are almost invisible, for example using the color
     `grey90' on a white background.

  3. Things become cleaner still if you skip all the even levels and
     use only odd levels 1, 3, 5..., effectively adding two stars to go
     from one outline level to the next(6).  In this way we get the
     outline view shown at the beginning of this section.  In order to
     make the structure editing and export commands handle this
     convention correctly, configure the variable
     `org-odd-levels-only', or set this on a per-file basis with one of
     the following lines:

          #+STARTUP: odd
          #+STARTUP: oddeven

     You can convert an Org file from single-star-per-level to the
     double-star-per-level convention with `M-x
     org-convert-to-odd-levels RET' in that file.  The reverse
     operation is `M-x org-convert-to-oddeven-levels'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Emacs 23.1 can actually crash with `org-indent-mode'

   (2) `org-indent-mode' also sets the `wrap-prefix' property, such
that `visual-line-mode' (or purely setting `word-wrap') wraps long
lines (including headlines) correctly indented.

15.9 Using Org on a tty
=======================

Because Org contains a large number of commands, by default many of
Org's core commands are bound to keys that are generally not accessible
on a tty, such as the cursor keys (<left>, <right>, <up>, <down>),
<TAB> and <RET>, in particular when used together with modifiers like
<Meta> and/or <Shift>.  To access these commands on a tty when special
keys are unavailable, the following alternative bindings can be used.
The tty bindings below will likely be more cumbersome; you may find for
some of the bindings below that a customized workaround suits you
better.  For example, changing a timestamp is really only fun with
`S-<cursor>' keys, whereas on a tty you would rather use `C-c .' to
re-insert the timestamp.

Org lives in the world of GNU Emacs and interacts in various ways with
other code out there.

File: org,  Node: Cooperation,  Next: Conflicts,  Prev: Interaction,  Up: Interaction

15.10.1 Packages that Org cooperates with
-----------------------------------------

`calc.el' by Dave Gillespie
     Org uses the Calc package for implementing spreadsheet
     functionality in its tables (*note The spreadsheet::).  Org checks
     for the availability of Calc by looking for the function
     `calc-eval' which will have been autoloaded during setup if Calc
     has been installed properly.  As of Emacs 22, Calc is part of the
     Emacs distribution.  Another possibility for interaction between
     the two packages is using Calc for embedded calculations.  *Note
     Embedded Mode: (calc)Embedded Mode.

`constants.el' by Carsten Dominik
     In a table formula (*note The spreadsheet::), it is possible to use
     names for natural constants or units.  Instead of defining your own
     constants in the variable `org-table-formula-constants', install
     the `constants' package which defines a large number of constants
     and units, and lets you use unit prefixes like `M' for `Mega',
     etc.  You will need version 2.0 of this package, available at
     `http://www.astro.uva.nl/~dominik/Tools'.  Org checks for the
     function `constants-get', which has to be autoloaded in your
     setup.  See the installation instructions in the file
     `constants.el'.

`cdlatex.el' by Carsten Dominik
     Org mode can make use of the CDLaTeX package to efficiently enter
     LaTeX fragments into Org files.  See *note CDLaTeX mode::.

`imenu.el' by Ake Stenhoff and Lars Lindberg
     Imenu allows menu access to an index of items in a file.  Org mode
     supports Imenu--all you need to do to get the index is the
     following:
          (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
                    (lambda () (imenu-add-to-menubar "Imenu")))
     By default the index is two levels deep--you can modify the depth
     using the option `org-imenu-depth'.

`remember.el' by John Wiegley
     Org used to use this package for capture, but no longer does.

`speedbar.el' by Eric M. Ludlam
     Speedbar is a package that creates a special frame displaying
     files and index items in files.  Org mode supports Speedbar and
     allows you to drill into Org files directly from the Speedbar.  It
     also allows you to restrict the scope of agenda commands to a file
     or a subtree by using the command `<' in the Speedbar frame.  

`table.el' by Takaaki Ota
     Complex ASCII tables with automatic line wrapping, column- and
     row-spanning, and alignment can be created using the Emacs table
     package by Takaaki Ota (`http://sourceforge.net/projects/table',
     and also part of Emacs 22).  Org mode will recognize these tables
     and export them properly.  Because of interference with other Org
     mode functionality, you unfortunately cannot edit these tables
     directly in the buffer.  Instead, you need to use the command `C-c
     '' to edit them, similar to source code snippets.

    `C-c '     (`org-edit-special')'
          Edit a `table.el' table.  Works when the cursor is in a
          table.el table.  

    `C-c ~     (`org-table-create-with-table.el')'
          Insert a `table.el' table.  If there is already a table at
          point, this command converts it between the `table.el' format
          and the Org mode format.  See the documentation string of the
          command `org-convert-table' for the restrictions under which
          this is possible.
     `table.el' is part of Emacs since Emacs 22.

`footnote.el' by Steven L. Baur
     Org mode recognizes numerical footnotes as provided by this
     package.  However, Org mode also has its own footnote support
     (*note Footnotes::), which makes using `footnote.el' unnecessary.


File: org,  Node: Conflicts,  Prev: Cooperation,  Up: Interaction

15.10.2 Packages that lead to conflicts with Org mode
-----------------------------------------------------

     In Emacs 23, `shift-selection-mode' is on by default, meaning that
     cursor motions combined with the shift key should start or enlarge
     regions.  This conflicts with the use of `S-<cursor>' commands in
     Org to change timestamps, TODO keywords, priorities, and item
     bullet types if the cursor is at such a location.  By default,
     `S-<cursor>' commands outside special contexts don't do anything,
     but you can customize the variable `org-support-shift-select'.
     Org mode then tries to accommodate shift selection by (i) using it
     outside of the special contexts where special commands apply, and
     by (ii) extending an existing active region even if the cursor
     moves across a special context.

`CUA.el' by Kim. F. Storm
     Key bindings in Org conflict with the `S-<cursor>' keys used by
     CUA mode (as well as `pc-select-mode' and `s-region-mode') to
     select and extend the region.  In fact, Emacs 23 has this built-in
     in the form of `shift-selection-mode', see previous paragraph.  If
     you are using Emacs 23, you probably don't want to use another
     package for this purpose.  However, if you prefer to leave these
     keys to a different package while working in Org mode, configure
     the variable `org-replace-disputed-keys'.  When set, Org will move
     the following key bindings in Org files, and in the agenda buffer
     (but not during date selection).

          S-UP      =>  M-p             S-DOWN     =>  M-n
          S-LEFT    =>  M--             S-RIGHT    =>  M-+
          C-S-LEFT  =>  M-S--           C-S-RIGHT  =>  M-S-+

     Yes, these are unfortunately more difficult to remember.  If you
     want to have other replacement keys, look at the variable
     `org-disputed-keys'.

`ecomplete.el' by Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen <larsi@gnus.org>
     Ecomplete provides "electric" address completion in address header
     lines in message buffers.  Sadly Orgtbl mode cuts ecompletes power
     supply: No completion happens when Orgtbl mode is enabled in
     message buffers while entering text in address header lines.  If
     one wants to use ecomplete one should _not_ follow the advice to
     automagically turn on Orgtbl mode in message buffers (see *note
     Orgtbl mode::), but instead--after filling in the message
     headers--turn on Orgtbl mode manually when needed in the messages
     body.

`filladapt.el' by Kyle Jones
     Org mode tries to do the right thing when filling paragraphs, list
     items and other elements.  Many users reported they had problems
     using both `filladapt.el' and Org mode, so a safe thing to do is
     to disable it like this:

          (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-off-filladapt-mode)

`yasnippet.el'
     The way Org mode binds the <TAB> key (binding to `[tab]' instead of
     `"\t"') overrules YASnippet's access to this key.  The following
     code fixed this problem:

          (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
                    (lambda ()
                      (org-set-local 'yas/trigger-key [tab])
                      (define-key yas/keymap [tab] 'yas/next-field-or-maybe-expand)))

     The latest version of yasnippet doesn't play well with Org mode.
     If the above code does not fix the conflict, start by defining the
     following function:

          (defun yas/org-very-safe-expand ()
            (let ((yas/fallback-behavior 'return-nil)) (yas/expand)))

     Then, tell Org mode what to do with the new function:

          (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
                    (lambda ()
                      (make-variable-buffer-local 'yas/trigger-key)
                      (setq yas/trigger-key [tab])
                      (add-to-list 'org-tab-first-hook 'yas/org-very-safe-expand)
                      (define-key yas/keymap [tab] 'yas/next-field)))

`windmove.el' by Hovav Shacham
     This package also uses the `S-<cursor>' keys, so everything written
     in the paragraph above about CUA mode also applies here.  If you
     want make the windmove function active in locations where Org mode
     does not have special functionality on `S-<cursor>', add this to
     your configuration:

          ;; Make windmove work in org-mode:
          (add-hook 'org-shiftup-final-hook 'windmove-up)
          (add-hook 'org-shiftleft-final-hook 'windmove-left)
          (add-hook 'org-shiftdown-final-hook 'windmove-down)
          (add-hook 'org-shiftright-final-hook 'windmove-right)

`viper.el' by Michael Kifer
     Viper uses `C-c /' and therefore makes this key not access the
     corresponding Org mode command `org-sparse-tree'.  You need to find
     another key for this command, or override the key in
     `viper-vi-global-user-map' with

          (define-key viper-vi-global-user-map "C-c /" 'org-sparse-tree)



File: org,  Node: org-crypt,  Prev: Interaction,  Up: Miscellaneous

15.11 org-crypt.el
==================

Org-crypt will encrypt the text of an entry, but not the headline, or
properties.  Org-crypt uses the Emacs EasyPG library to encrypt and
decrypt files.

   Any text below a headline that has a `:crypt:' tag will be
automatically be encrypted when the file is saved.  If you want to use
a different tag just customize the `org-crypt-tag-matcher' setting.

   To use org-crypt it is suggested that you have the following in your
`.emacs':

     (require 'org-crypt)
     (org-crypt-use-before-save-magic)
     (setq org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance (quote ("crypt")))

     (setq org-crypt-key nil)
       ;; GPG key to use for encryption
       ;; Either the Key ID or set to nil to use symmetric encryption.

     (setq auto-save-default nil)
       ;; Auto-saving does not cooperate with org-crypt.el: so you need
       ;; to turn it off if you plan to use org-crypt.el quite often.
       ;; Otherwise, you'll get an (annoying) message each time you
       ;; start Org.

       ;; To turn it off only locally, you can insert this:
       ;;
       ;; # -*- buffer-auto-save-file-name: nil; -*-

   Excluding the crypt tag from inheritance prevents already encrypted
text being encrypted again.

A.1 Hooks
=========

Org has a large number of hook variables that can be used to add
functionality.  This appendix about hacking is going to illustrate the
use of some of them.  A complete list of all hooks with documentation is
maintained by the Worg project and can be found at
`http://orgmode.org/worg/org-configs/org-hooks.php'.

A.2 Add-on packages
===================

A large number of add-on packages have been written by various authors.

   These packages are not part of Emacs, but they are distributed as
contributed packages with the separate release available at
`http://orgmode.org'.  See the `contrib/README' file in the source code
directory for a list of contributed files.  You may also find some more
information on the Worg page: `http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/'.

A.3 Adding hyperlink types
==========================

Org has a large number of hyperlink types built-in (*note
Hyperlinks::).  If you would like to add new link types, Org provides
an interface for doing so.  Let's look at an example file,
`org-man.el', that will add support for creating links like
`[[man:printf][The printf manpage]]' to show Unix manual pages inside
Emacs:

     ;;; org-man.el - Support for links to manpages in Org

     (require 'org)

     (org-add-link-type "man" 'org-man-open)
     (add-hook 'org-store-link-functions 'org-man-store-link)

     (defcustom org-man-command 'man
       "The Emacs command to be used to display a man page."
       :group 'org-link
       :type '(choice (const man) (const woman)))

     (defun org-man-open (path)
       "Visit the manpage on PATH.
     PATH should be a topic that can be thrown at the man command."
       (funcall org-man-command path))

     (defun org-man-store-link ()
       "Store a link to a manpage."
       (when (memq major-mode '(Man-mode woman-mode))
         ;; This is a man page, we do make this link
         (let* ((page (org-man-get-page-name))
                (link (concat "man:" page))
                (description (format "Manpage for %s" page)))
           (org-store-link-props
            :type "man"
            :link link
            :description description))))

     (defun org-man-get-page-name ()
       "Extract the page name from the buffer name."
       ;; This works for both `Man-mode' and `woman-mode'.
       (if (string-match " \\(\\S-+\\)\\*" (buffer-name))
           (match-string 1 (buffer-name))
         (error "Cannot create link to this man page")))

     (provide 'org-man)

     ;;; org-man.el ends here

You would activate this new link type in `.emacs' with

     (require 'org-man)

Let's go through the file and see what it does.
  1. It does `(require 'org)' to make sure that `org.el' has been
     loaded.

  2. The next line calls `org-add-link-type' to define a new link type
     with prefix `man'.  The call also contains the name of a function
     that will be called to follow such a link.

  3. The next line adds a function to `org-store-link-functions', in
     order to allow the command `C-c l' to record a useful link in a
     buffer displaying a man page.

   The rest of the file defines the necessary variables and functions.
First there is a customization variable that determines which Emacs
command should be used to display man pages.  There are two options,
`man' and `woman'.  Then the function to follow a link is defined.  It
gets the link path as an argument--in this case the link path is just a
topic for the manual command.  The function calls the value of
`org-man-command' to display the man page.

   Finally the function `org-man-store-link' is defined.  When you try
to store a link with `C-c l', this function will be called to try to
make a link.  The function must first decide if it is supposed to
create the link for this buffer type; we do this by checking the value
of the variable `major-mode'.  If not, the function must exit and
return the value `nil'.  If yes, the link is created by getting the
manual topic from the buffer name and prefixing it with the string
`man:'.  Then it must call the command `org-store-link-props' and set
the `:type' and `:link' properties.  Optionally you can also set the
`:description' property to provide a default for the link description
when the link is later inserted into an Org buffer with `C-c C-l'.

   When it makes sense for your new link type, you may also define a
function `org-PREFIX-complete-link' that implements special (e.g.,
completion) support for inserting such a link with `C-c C-l'.  Such a
function should not accept any arguments, and return the full link with
prefix.


File: org,  Node: Adding export back-ends,  Next: Context-sensitive commands,  Prev: Adding hyperlink types,  Up: Hacking

A.4 Adding export back-ends
===========================

Org 8.0 comes with a completely rewritten export engine which makes it
easy to write new export back-ends, either from scratch, or from
deriving them from existing ones.

   Your two entry points are respectively `org-export-define-backend'
and `org-export-define-derived-backend'.  To grok these functions, you
should first have a look at `ox-latex.el' (for how to define a new
back-end from scratch) and `ox-beamer.el' (for how to derive a new
back-end from an existing one.

   When creating a new back-end from scratch, the basic idea is to set
the name of the back-end (as a symbol) and an an alist of elements and
export functions.  On top of this, you will need to set additional
keywords like `:menu-entry' (to display the back-end in the export
dispatcher), `:export-block' (to specify what blocks should not be
exported by this back-end), and `:options-alist' (to let the user set
export options that are specific to this back-end.)

   Deriving a new back-end is similar, except that you need to set
`:translate-alist' to an alist of export functions that should be used
instead of the parent back-end functions.

   For a complete reference documentation, see the Org Export Reference
on Worg (http://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-export-reference.html).


File: org,  Node: Context-sensitive commands,  Next: Tables in arbitrary syntax,  Prev: Adding export back-ends,  Up: Hacking

A.5 Context-sensitive commands
==============================

Org has several commands that act differently depending on context.
The most important example is the `C-c C-c' (*note The very busy C-c
C-c key::).  Also the `M-cursor' and `M-S-cursor' keys have this
property.

   Add-ons can tap into this functionality by providing a function that
detects special context for that add-on and executes functionality
appropriate for the context.  Here is an example from Dan Davison's
`org-R.el' which allows you to evaluate commands based on the `R'
programming language (1).  For this package, special contexts are lines
that start with `#+R:' or `#+RR:'.

     (defun org-R-apply-maybe ()
       "Detect if this is context for org-R and execute R commands."
       (if (save-excursion
             (beginning-of-line 1)
             (looking-at "#\\+RR?:"))
           (progn (call-interactively 'org-R-apply)
                  t) ;; to signal that we took action
         nil)) ;; to signal that we did not

     (add-hook 'org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c-hook 'org-R-apply-maybe)

   The function first checks if the cursor is in such a line.  If that
is the case, `org-R-apply' is called and the function returns `t' to
signal that action was taken, and `C-c C-c' will stop looking for other
contexts.  If the function finds it should do nothing locally, it
returns `nil' so that other, similar functions can have a try.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) `org-R.el' has been replaced by the Org mode functionality
described in *note Working With Source Code:: and is now obsolete.


File: org,  Node: Tables in arbitrary syntax,  Next: Dynamic blocks,  Prev: Context-sensitive commands,  Up: Hacking

A.6 Tables and lists in arbitrary syntax
========================================

Since Orgtbl mode can be used as a minor mode in arbitrary buffers, a
frequent feature request has been to make it work with native tables in
specific languages, for example LaTeX.  However, this is extremely hard
to do in a general way, would lead to a customization nightmare, and
would take away much of the simplicity of the Orgtbl mode table editor.

   This appendix describes a different approach.  We keep the Orgtbl
mode table in its native format (the source table), and use a custom
function to translate the table to the correct syntax, and to install
it in the right location (the target table).  This puts the burden of
writing conversion functions on the user, but it allows for a very
flexible system.

   Bastien added the ability to do the same with lists, in Orgstruct
mode.  You can use Org's facilities to edit and structure lists by
turning `orgstruct-mode' on, then locally exporting such lists in
another format (HTML, LaTeX or Texinfo.)

File: org,  Node: Radio tables,  Next: A LaTeX example,  Prev: Tables in arbitrary syntax,  Up: Tables in arbitrary syntax

A.6.1 Radio tables
------------------

To define the location of the target table, you first need to create two
lines that are comments in the current mode, but contain magic words
`BEGIN/END RECEIVE ORGTBL' for Orgtbl mode to find.  Orgtbl mode will
insert the translated table between these lines, replacing whatever was
there before.  For example in C mode where comments are between `/* ...
*/':

     /* BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL table_name */
     /* END RECEIVE ORGTBL table_name */

Just above the source table, we put a special line that tells Orgtbl
mode how to translate this table and where to install it.  For example: 
     #+ORGTBL: SEND table_name translation_function arguments....

`table_name' is the reference name for the table that is also used in
the receiver lines.  `translation_function' is the Lisp function that
does the translation.  Furthermore, the line can contain a list of
arguments (alternating key and value) at the end.  The arguments will be
passed as a property list to the translation function for
interpretation.  A few standard parameters are already recognized and
acted upon before the translation function is called:

`:skip N'
     Skip the first N lines of the table.  Hlines do count as separate
     lines for this parameter!

`:skipcols (n1 n2 ...)'
     List of columns that should be skipped.  If the table has a column
     with calculation marks, that column is automatically discarded as
     well.  Please note that the translator function sees the table
     _after_ the removal of these columns, the function never knows
     that there have been additional columns.

`:no-escape t'
     When non-`nil', do not escape special characters `&%#_^' when
     exporting the table.  The default value is `nil'.

The one problem remaining is how to keep the source table in the buffer
without disturbing the normal workings of the file, for example during
compilation of a C file or processing of a LaTeX file.  There are a
number of different solutions:

   * The table could be placed in a block comment if that is supported
     by the language.  For example, in C mode you could wrap the table
     between `/*' and `*/' lines.

   * Sometimes it is possible to put the table after some kind of END
     statement, for example `\bye' in TeX and `\end{document}' in LaTeX.

   * You can just comment the table line-by-line whenever you want to
     process the file, and uncomment it whenever you need to edit the
     table.  This only sounds tedious--the command `M-x
     orgtbl-toggle-comment RET' makes this comment-toggling very easy,
     in particular if you bind it to a key.


File: org,  Node: A LaTeX example,  Next: Translator functions,  Prev: Radio tables,  Up: Tables in arbitrary syntax

A.6.2 A LaTeX example of radio tables
-------------------------------------

The best way to wrap the source table in LaTeX is to use the `comment'
environment provided by `comment.sty'.  It has to be activated by
placing `\usepackage{comment}' into the document header.  Orgtbl mode
can insert a radio table skeleton(1)  with the command `M-x
orgtbl-insert-radio-table RET'.  You will be prompted for a table name,
let's say we use `salesfigures'.  You will then get the following
template:

     % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     % END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     \begin{comment}
     #+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex
     | | |
     \end{comment}

The `#+ORGTBL: SEND' line tells Orgtbl mode to use the function
`orgtbl-to-latex' to convert the table into LaTeX and to put it into
the receiver location with name `salesfigures'.  You may now fill in
the table--feel free to use the spreadsheet features(2):

     % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     % END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     \begin{comment}
     #+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex
     | Month | Days | Nr sold | per day |
     |-------+------+---------+---------|
     | Jan   |   23 |      55 |     2.4 |
     | Feb   |   21 |      16 |     0.8 |
     | March |   22 |     278 |    12.6 |
     #+TBLFM: $4=$3/$2;%.1f
     % $ (optional extra dollar to keep font-lock happy, see footnote)
     \end{comment}

When you are done, press `C-c C-c' in the table to get the converted
table inserted between the two marker lines.

   Now let's assume you want to make the table header by hand, because
you want to control how columns are aligned, etc.  In this case we make
sure that the table translator skips the first 2 lines of the source
table, and tell the command to work as a splice, i.e., to not produce
header and footer commands of the target table:

     \begin{tabular}{lrrr}
     Month & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Days} & Nr.\ sold & per day\\
     % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     % END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     \end{tabular}
     %
     \begin{comment}
     #+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex :splice t :skip 2
     | Month | Days | Nr sold | per day |
     |-------+------+---------+---------|
     | Jan   |   23 |      55 |     2.4 |
     | Feb   |   21 |      16 |     0.8 |
     | March |   22 |     278 |    12.6 |
     #+TBLFM: $4=$3/$2;%.1f
     \end{comment}

   The LaTeX translator function `orgtbl-to-latex' is already part of
Orgtbl mode.  It uses a `tabular' environment to typeset the table and
marks horizontal lines with `\hline'.  Furthermore, it interprets the
following parameters (see also *note Translator functions::):

`:splice nil/t'
     When set to t, return only table body lines, don't wrap them into a
     tabular environment.  Default is `nil'.

`:fmt fmt'
     A format to be used to wrap each field, it should contain `%s' for
     the original field value.  For example, to wrap each field value
     in dollars, you could use `:fmt "$%s$"'.  This may also be a
     property list with column numbers and formats, for example `:fmt
     (2 "$%s$" 4 "%s\\%%")'.  A function of one argument can be used in
     place of the strings; the function must return a formatted string.

`:efmt efmt'
     Use this format to print numbers with exponentials.  The format
     should have `%s' twice for inserting mantissa and exponent, for
     example `"%s\\times10^{%s}"'.  The default is `"%s\\,(%s)"'.  This
     may also be a property list with column numbers and formats, for
     example `:efmt (2 "$%s\\times10^{%s}$" 4 "$%s\\cdot10^{%s}$")'.
     After `efmt' has been applied to a value, `fmt' will also be
     applied.  Similar to `fmt', functions of two arguments can be
     supplied instead of strings.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) By default this works only for LaTeX, HTML, and Texinfo.
Configure the variable `orgtbl-radio-table-templates' to install
templates for other modes.

   (2) If the `#+TBLFM' line contains an odd number of dollar
characters, this may cause problems with font-lock in LaTeX mode.  As
shown in the example you can fix this by adding an extra line inside the
`comment' environment that is used to balance the dollar expressions.
If you are using AUCTeX with the font-latex library, a much better
solution is to add the `comment' environment to the variable
`LaTeX-verbatim-environments'.

A.6.3 Translator functions
--------------------------

Orgtbl mode has several translator functions built-in: `orgtbl-to-csv'
(comma-separated values), `orgtbl-to-tsv' (TAB-separated values)
`orgtbl-to-latex', `orgtbl-to-html', and `orgtbl-to-texinfo'.  Except
for `orgtbl-to-html'(1), these all use a generic translator,
`orgtbl-to-generic'.  For example, `orgtbl-to-latex' itself is a very
short function that computes the column definitions for the `tabular'
environment, defines a few field and line separators and then hands
processing over to the generic translator.  Here is the entire code:

     (defun orgtbl-to-latex (table params)
       "Convert the Orgtbl mode TABLE to LaTeX."
       (let* ((alignment (mapconcat (lambda (x) (if x "r" "l"))
                                    org-table-last-alignment ""))
              (params2
               (list
                :tstart (concat "\\begin{tabular}{" alignment "}")
                :tend "\\end{tabular}"
                :lstart "" :lend " \\\\" :sep " & "
                :efmt "%s\\,(%s)" :hline "\\hline")))
         (orgtbl-to-generic table (org-combine-plists params2 params))))

   As you can see, the properties passed into the function (variable
PARAMS) are combined with the ones newly defined in the function
(variable PARAMS2).  The ones passed into the function (i.e., the ones
set by the `ORGTBL SEND' line) take precedence.  So if you would like
to use the LaTeX translator, but wanted the line endings to be
`\\[2mm]' instead of the default `\\', you could just overrule the
default with

     #+ORGTBL: SEND test orgtbl-to-latex :lend " \\\\[2mm]"

   For a new language, you can either write your own converter function
in analogy with the LaTeX translator, or you can use the generic
function directly.  For example, if you have a language where a table
is started with `!BTBL!', ended with `!ETBL!', and where table lines are
started with `!BL!', ended with `!EL!', and where the field separator
is a TAB, you could call the generic translator like this (on a single
line!):

     #+ORGTBL: SEND test orgtbl-to-generic :tstart "!BTBL!" :tend "!ETBL!"
                                   :lstart "!BL! " :lend " !EL!" :sep "\t"

Please check the documentation string of the function
`orgtbl-to-generic' for a full list of parameters understood by that
function, and remember that you can pass each of them into
`orgtbl-to-latex', `orgtbl-to-texinfo', and any other function using
the generic function.

   Of course you can also write a completely new function doing
complicated things the generic translator cannot do.  A translator
function takes two arguments.  The first argument is the table, a list
of lines, each line either the symbol `hline' or a list of fields.  The
second argument is the property list containing all parameters
specified in the `#+ORGTBL: SEND' line.  The function must return a
single string containing the formatted table.  If you write a generally
useful translator, please post it on <emacs-orgmode@gnu.org> so that
others can benefit from your work.

   (1) The HTML translator uses the same code that produces tables
during HTML export.


File: org,  Node: Radio lists,  Prev: Translator functions,  Up: Tables in arbitrary syntax

A.6.4 Radio lists
-----------------

Sending and receiving radio lists works exactly the same way as sending
and receiving radio tables (*note Radio tables::).  As for radio
tables, you can insert radio list templates in HTML, LaTeX and Texinfo
modes by calling `org-list-insert-radio-list'.

   Here are the differences with radio tables:

   - Orgstruct mode must be active.

   - Use the `ORGLST' keyword instead of `ORGTBL'.

   - The available translation functions for radio lists don't take
     parameters.

   - `C-c C-c' will work when pressed on the first item of the list.

   Here is a LaTeX example.  Let's say that you have this in your LaTeX
file:

     % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGLST to-buy
     % END RECEIVE ORGLST to-buy
     \begin{comment}
     #+ORGLST: SEND to-buy org-list-to-latex
     - a new house
     - a new computer
       + a new keyboard
       + a new mouse
     - a new life
     \end{comment}

   Pressing `C-c C-c' on `a new house' and will insert the converted
LaTeX list between the two marker lines.


File: org,  Node: Dynamic blocks,  Next: Special agenda views,  Prev: Tables in arbitrary syntax,  Up: Hacking

A.7 Dynamic blocks
==================

Org documents can contain _dynamic blocks_.  These are specially marked
regions that are updated by some user-written function.  A good example
for such a block is the clock table inserted by the command `C-c C-x
C-r' (*note Clocking work time::).

   Dynamic blocks are enclosed by a BEGIN-END structure that assigns a
name to the block and can also specify parameters for the function
producing the content of the block.

     #+BEGIN: myblock :parameter1 value1 :parameter2 value2 ...

     #+END:

   Dynamic blocks are updated with the following commands

`C-c C-x C-u     (`org-dblock-update')'
     Update dynamic block at point.  

`C-u C-c C-x C-u'
     Update all dynamic blocks in the current file.

   Updating a dynamic block means to remove all the text between BEGIN
and END, parse the BEGIN line for parameters and then call the specific
writer function for this block to insert the new content.  If you want
to use the original content in the writer function, you can use the
extra parameter `:content'.

   For a block with name `myblock', the writer function is
`org-dblock-write:myblock' with as only parameter a property list with
the parameters given in the begin line.  Here is a trivial example of a
block that keeps track of when the block update function was last run:

     #+BEGIN: block-update-time :format "on %m/%d/%Y at %H:%M"

     #+END:

The corresponding block writer function could look like this:

     (defun org-dblock-write:block-update-time (params)
       (let ((fmt (or (plist-get params :format) "%d. %m. %Y")))
         (insert "Last block update at: "
                 (format-time-string fmt (current-time)))))

   If you want to make sure that all dynamic blocks are always
up-to-date, you could add the function `org-update-all-dblocks' to a
hook, for example `before-save-hook'.  `org-update-all-dblocks' is
written in a way such that it does nothing in buffers that are not in
`org-mode'.

   You can narrow the current buffer to the current dynamic block (like
any other block) with `org-narrow-to-block'.


File: org,  Node: Special agenda views,  Next: Speeding up your agendas,  Prev: Dynamic blocks,  Up: Hacking

A.8 Special agenda views
========================

Org provides a special hook that can be used to narrow down the
selection made by these agenda views: `agenda', `agenda*'(1), `todo',
`alltodo', `tags', `tags-todo', `tags-tree'.  You may specify a
function that is used at each match to verify if the match should
indeed be part of the agenda view, and if not, how much should be
skipped.  You can specify a global condition that will be applied to
all agenda views, this condition would be stored in the variable
`org-agenda-skip-function-global'.  More commonly, such a definition is
applied only to specific custom searches, using
`org-agenda-skip-function'.

   Let's say you want to produce a list of projects that contain a
WAITING tag anywhere in the project tree.  Let's further assume that
you have marked all tree headings that define a project with the TODO
keyword PROJECT.  In this case you would run a TODO search for the
keyword PROJECT, but skip the match unless there is a WAITING tag
anywhere in the subtree belonging to the project line.

   To achieve this, you must write a function that searches the subtree
for the tag.  If the tag is found, the function must return `nil' to
indicate that this match should not be skipped.  If there is no such
tag, return the location of the end of the subtree, to indicate that
search should continue from there.

     (defun my-skip-unless-waiting ()
       "Skip trees that are not waiting"
       (let ((subtree-end (save-excursion (org-end-of-subtree t))))
         (if (re-search-forward ":waiting:" subtree-end t)
             nil          ; tag found, do not skip
           subtree-end))) ; tag not found, continue after end of subtree

   Now you may use this function in an agenda custom command, for
example like this:

     (org-add-agenda-custom-command
      '("b" todo "PROJECT"
        ((org-agenda-skip-function 'my-skip-unless-waiting)
         (org-agenda-overriding-header "Projects waiting for something: "))))

   Note that this also binds `org-agenda-overriding-header' to get a
meaningful header in the agenda view.

   A general way to create custom searches is to base them on a search
for entries with a certain level limit.  If you want to study all
entries with your custom search function, simply do a search for
`LEVEL>0'(2), and then use `org-agenda-skip-function' to select the
entries you really want to have.

   You may also put a Lisp form into `org-agenda-skip-function'.  In
particular, you may use the functions `org-agenda-skip-entry-if' and
`org-agenda-skip-subtree-if' in this form, for example:

`(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'scheduled)'
     Skip current entry if it has been scheduled.

`(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'notscheduled)'
     Skip current entry if it has not been scheduled.

`(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'deadline)'
     Skip current entry if it has a deadline.

`(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'scheduled 'deadline)'
     Skip current entry if it has a deadline, or if it is scheduled.

`(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'todo '("TODO" "WAITING"))'
     Skip current entry if the TODO keyword is TODO or WAITING.

`(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'todo 'done)'
     Skip current entry if the TODO keyword marks a DONE state.

`(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'timestamp)'
     Skip current entry if it has any timestamp, may also be deadline
     or scheduled.

`(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'regexp "regular expression")'
     Skip current entry if the regular expression matches in the entry.

`(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'notregexp "regular expression")'
     Skip current entry unless the regular expression matches.

`(org-agenda-skip-subtree-if 'regexp "regular expression")'
     Same as above, but check and skip the entire subtree.

   Therefore we could also have written the search for WAITING projects
like this, even without defining a special function:

     (org-add-agenda-custom-command
      '("b" todo "PROJECT"
        ((org-agenda-skip-function '(org-agenda-skip-subtree-if
                                     'regexp ":waiting:"))
         (org-agenda-overriding-header "Projects waiting for something: "))))

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The `agenda*' view is the same than `agenda' except that it only
considers _appointments_, i.e., scheduled and deadline items that have a
time specification `[h]h:mm' in their time-stamps.

   (2) Note that, when using `org-odd-levels-only', a level number
corresponds to order in the hierarchy, not to the number of stars.

A.9 Speeding up your agendas
============================

When your Org files grow in both number and size, agenda commands may
start to become slow.  Below are some tips on how to speed up the
agenda commands.

  1. Reduce the number of Org agenda files: this will reduce the
     slowness caused by accessing a hard drive.

  2. Reduce the number of DONE and archived headlines: this way the
     agenda does not need to skip them.

  3. Inhibit the dimming of blocked tasks:
          (setq org-agenda-dim-blocked-tasks nil)

  4. Inhibit agenda files startup options:
          (setq org-agenda-inhibit-startup nil)

  5. Disable tag inheritance in agenda:
          (setq org-agenda-use-tag-inheritance nil)

   You can set these options for specific agenda views only.  See the
docstrings of these variables for details on why they affect the agenda
generation, and this dedicated Worg page
(http://orgmode.org/worg/agenda-optimization.html) for further
explanations.


File: org,  Node: Extracting agenda information,  Next: Using the property API,  Prev: Speeding up your agendas,  Up: Hacking

A.10 Extracting agenda information
==================================

Org provides commands to access agenda information for the command line
in Emacs batch mode.  This extracted information can be sent directly
to a printer, or it can be read by a program that does further
processing of the data.  The first of these commands is the function
`org-batch-agenda', that produces an agenda view and sends it as ASCII
text to STDOUT.  The command takes a single string as parameter.  If
the string has length 1, it is used as a key to one of the commands you
have configured in `org-agenda-custom-commands', basically any key you
can use after `C-c a'.  For example, to directly print the current TODO
list, you could use

     emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -eval '(org-batch-agenda "t")' | lpr

   If the parameter is a string with 2 or more characters, it is used
as a tags/TODO match string.  For example, to print your local shopping
list (all items with the tag `shop', but excluding the tag `NewYork'),
you could use

     emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs                                      \
           -eval '(org-batch-agenda "+shop-NewYork")' | lpr

You may also modify parameters on the fly like this:

     emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs                                      \
        -eval '(org-batch-agenda "a"                               \
                 org-agenda-span (quote month)                     \
                 org-agenda-include-diary nil                      \
                 org-agenda-files (quote ("~/org/project.org")))'  \
        | lpr

which will produce a 30-day agenda, fully restricted to the Org file
`~/org/projects.org', not even including the diary.

   If you want to process the agenda data in more sophisticated ways,
you can use the command `org-batch-agenda-csv' to get a comma-separated
list of values for each agenda item.  Each line in the output will
contain a number of fields separated by commas.  The fields in a line
are:

     category     The category of the item
     head         The headline, without TODO keyword, TAGS and PRIORITY
     type         The type of the agenda entry, can be
                     todo               selected in TODO match
                     tagsmatch          selected in tags match
                     diary              imported from diary
                     deadline           a deadline
                     scheduled          scheduled
                     timestamp          appointment, selected by timestamp
                     closed             entry was closed on date
                     upcoming-deadline  warning about nearing deadline
                     past-scheduled     forwarded scheduled item
                     block              entry has date block including date
     todo         The TODO keyword, if any
     tags         All tags including inherited ones, separated by colons
     date         The relevant date, like 2007-2-14
     time         The time, like 15:00-16:50
     extra        String with extra planning info
     priority-l   The priority letter if any was given
     priority-n   The computed numerical priority

Time and date will only be given if a timestamp (or deadline/scheduled)
led to the selection of the item.

   A CSV list like this is very easy to use in a post-processing script.
For example, here is a Perl program that gets the TODO list from
Emacs/Org and prints all the items, preceded by a checkbox:

     #!/usr/bin/perl

     # define the Emacs command to run
     $cmd = "emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -eval '(org-batch-agenda-csv \"t\")'";

     # run it and capture the output
     $agenda = qx{$cmd 2>/dev/null};

     # loop over all lines
     foreach $line (split(/\n/,$agenda)) {
       # get the individual values
       ($category,$head,$type,$todo,$tags,$date,$time,$extra,
        $priority_l,$priority_n) = split(/,/,$line);
       # process and print
       print "[ ] $head\n";
     }


File: org,  Node: Using the property API,  Next: Using the mapping API,  Prev: Extracting agenda information,  Up: Hacking

A.11 Using the property API
===========================

Here is a description of the functions that can be used to work with
properties.

 -- Function: org-entry-properties &optional pom which
     Get all properties of the entry at point-or-marker POM.
     This includes the TODO keyword, the tags, time strings for
     deadline, scheduled, and clocking, and any additional properties
     defined in the entry.  The return value is an alist.  Keys may
     occur multiple times if the property key was used several times.
     POM may also be `nil', in which case the current entry is used.
     If WHICH is `nil' or `all', get all properties.  If WHICH is
     `special' or `standard', only get that subclass.
   
 -- Function: org-entry-get pom property &optional inherit
     Get value of `PROPERTY' for entry at point-or-marker `POM'.  By
     default, this only looks at properties defined locally in the
     entry.  If `INHERIT' is non-`nil' and the entry does not have the
     property, then also check higher levels of the hierarchy.  If
     `INHERIT' is the symbol `selective', use inheritance if and only
     if the setting of `org-use-property-inheritance' selects
     `PROPERTY' for inheritance.

 -- Function: org-entry-delete pom property
     Delete the property `PROPERTY' from entry at point-or-marker POM.

 -- Function: org-entry-put pom property value
     Set `PROPERTY' to `VALUE' for entry at point-or-marker POM.

 -- Function: org-buffer-property-keys &optional include-specials
     Get all property keys in the current buffer.

 -- Function: org-insert-property-drawer
     Insert a property drawer for the current entry.  Also

 -- Function: org-entry-put-multivalued-property pom property &rest
          values
     Set `PROPERTY' at point-or-marker `POM' to `VALUES'.  `VALUES'
     should be a list of strings.  They will be concatenated, with
     spaces as separators.

 -- Function: org-entry-get-multivalued-property pom property
     Treat the value of the property `PROPERTY' as a
     whitespace-separated list of values and return the values as a
     list of strings.

 -- Function: org-entry-add-to-multivalued-property pom property value
     Treat the value of the property `PROPERTY' as a
     whitespace-separated list of values and make sure that `VALUE' is
     in this list.

 -- Function: org-entry-remove-from-multivalued-property pom property
          value
     Treat the value of the property `PROPERTY' as a
     whitespace-separated list of values and make sure that `VALUE' is
     _not_ in this list.

 -- Function: org-entry-member-in-multivalued-property pom property
          value
     Treat the value of the property `PROPERTY' as a
     whitespace-separated list of values and check if `VALUE' is in
     this list.

 -- User Option: org-property-allowed-value-functions
     Hook for functions supplying allowed values for a specific
     property.  The functions must take a single argument, the name of
     the property, and return a flat list of allowed values.  If `:ETC'
     is one of the values, use the values as completion help, but allow
     also other values to be entered.  The functions must return `nil'
     if they are not responsible for this property.


File: org,  Node: Using the mapping API,  Prev: Using the property API,  Up: Hacking

A.12 Using the mapping API
==========================

Org has sophisticated mapping capabilities to find all entries
satisfying certain criteria.  Internally, this functionality is used to
produce agenda views, but there is also an API that can be used to
execute arbitrary functions for each or selected entries.  The main
entry point for this API is:

 -- Function: org-map-entries func &optional match scope &rest skip
     Call `FUNC' at each headline selected by `MATCH' in `SCOPE'.

     `FUNC' is a function or a Lisp form.  The function will be called
     without arguments, with the cursor positioned at the beginning of
     the headline.  The return values of all calls to the function will
     be collected and returned as a list.

     The call to `FUNC' will be wrapped into a save-excursion form, so
     `FUNC' does not need to preserve point.  After evaluation, the
     cursor will be moved to the end of the line (presumably of the
     headline of the processed entry) and search continues from there.
     Under some circumstances, this may not produce the wanted results.
     For example, if you have removed (e.g., archived) the current
     (sub)tree it could mean that the next entry will be skipped
     entirely.  In such cases, you can specify the position from where
     search should continue by making `FUNC' set the variable
     `org-map-continue-from' to the desired buffer position.

     `MATCH' is a tags/property/todo match as it is used in the agenda
     match view.  Only headlines that are matched by this query will be
     considered during the iteration.  When `MATCH' is `nil' or `t', all
     headlines will be visited by the iteration.

     `SCOPE' determines the scope of this command.  It can be any of:

          nil     the current buffer, respecting the restriction if any
          tree    the subtree started with the entry at point
          region  The entries within the active region, if any
          file    the current buffer, without restriction
          file-with-archives
                  the current buffer, and any archives associated with it
          agenda  all agenda files
          agenda-with-archives
                  all agenda files with any archive files associated with them
          (file1 file2 ...)
                  if this is a list, all files in the list will be scanned
     The remaining args are treated as settings for the skipping
     facilities of the scanner.  The following items can be given here:

          archive   skip trees with the archive tag
          comment   skip trees with the COMMENT keyword
          function or Lisp form
                    will be used as value for `org-agenda-skip-function',
                    so whenever the function returns t, FUNC
                    will not be called for that entry and search will
                    continue from the point where the function leaves it

   The function given to that mapping routine can really do anything
you like.  It can use the property API (*note Using the property API::)
to gather more information about the entry, or in order to change
metadata in the entry.  Here are a couple of functions that might be
handy:

 -- Function: org-todo &optional arg
     Change the TODO state of the entry.  See the docstring of the
     functions for the many possible values for the argument `ARG'.

 -- Function: org-priority &optional action
     Change the priority of the entry.  See the docstring of this
     function for the possible values for `ACTION'.

 -- Function: org-toggle-tag tag &optional onoff
     Toggle the tag `TAG' in the current entry.  Setting `ONOFF' to
     either `on' or `off' will not toggle tag, but ensure that it is
     either on or off.

 -- Function: org-promote
     Promote the current entry.

 -- Function: org-demote
     Demote the current entry.

   Here is a simple example that will turn all entries in the current
file with a tag `TOMORROW' into TODO entries with the keyword
`UPCOMING'.  Entries in comment trees and in archive trees will be
ignored.

     (org-map-entries
      '(org-todo "UPCOMING")
      "+TOMORROW" 'file 'archive 'comment)

   The following example counts the number of entries with TODO keyword
`WAITING', in all agenda files.

     (length (org-map-entries t "/+WAITING" 'agenda))

Appendix B MobileOrg
********************

MobileOrg is the name of the mobile companion app for Org mode,
currently available for iOS and for Android.  MobileOrg offers offline
viewing and capture support for an Org mode system rooted on a "real"
computer.  It does also allow you to record changes to existing
entries.  The iOS implementation (https://github.com/MobileOrg/) for the
iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad series of devices, was started by Richard
Moreland and is now in the hands Sean Escriva.  Android users should
check out MobileOrg Android
(http://wiki.github.com/matburt/mobileorg-android/) by Matt Jones.  The
two implementations are not identical but offer similar features.

   This appendix describes the support Org has for creating agenda
views in a format that can be displayed by MobileOrg, and for
integrating notes captured and changes made by MobileOrg into the main
system.

   For changing tags and TODO states in MobileOrg, you should have set
up the customization variables `org-todo-keywords' and `org-tag-alist'
to cover all important tags and TODO keywords, even if individual files
use only part of these.  MobileOrg will also offer you states and tags
set up with in-buffer settings, but it will understand the logistics of
TODO state sets (*note Per-file keywords::) and mutually exclusive tags
(*note Setting tags::) only for those set in these variables.

File: org,  Node: Setting up the staging area,  Next: Pushing to MobileOrg,  Prev: MobileOrg,  Up: MobileOrg

B.1 Setting up the staging area
===============================

MobileOrg needs to interact with Emacs through a directory on a server.
If you are using a public server, you should consider to encrypt the
files that are uploaded to the server.  This can be done with Org mode
7.02 and with MobileOrg 1.5 (iPhone version), and you need an `openssl'
installation on your system.  To turn on encryption, set a password in
MobileOrg and, on the Emacs side, configure the variable
`org-mobile-use-encryption'(1).

   The easiest way to create that directory is to use a free
Dropbox.com (http://dropbox.com) account(2).  When MobileOrg first
connects to your Dropbox, it will create a directory MobileOrg inside
the Dropbox.  After the directory has been created, tell Emacs about it:

     (setq org-mobile-directory "~/Dropbox/MobileOrg")

   Org mode has commands to put files for MobileOrg into that directory,
and to read captured notes from there.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If you can safely store the password in your Emacs setup, you
might also want to configure `org-mobile-encryption-password'.  Please
read the docstring of that variable.  Note that encryption will apply
only to the contents of the `.org' files.  The file names themselves
will remain visible.

   (2) If you cannot use Dropbox, or if your version of MobileOrg does
not support it, you can use a webdav server.  For more information,
check out the documentation of MobileOrg and also this FAQ entry
(http://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.html#mobileorg_webdav).


File: org,  Node: Pushing to MobileOrg,  Next: Pulling from MobileOrg,  Prev: Setting up the staging area,  Up: MobileOrg

B.2 Pushing to MobileOrg
========================

This operation copies all files currently listed in `org-mobile-files'
to the directory `org-mobile-directory'.  By default this list contains
all agenda files (as listed in `org-agenda-files'), but additional files
can be included by customizing `org-mobile-files'.  File names will be
staged with paths relative to `org-directory', so all files should be
inside this directory(1).

   The push operation also creates a special Org file `agendas.org' with
all custom agenda view defined by the user(2).

   Finally, Org writes the file `index.org', containing links to all
other files.  MobileOrg first reads this file from the server, and then
downloads all agendas and Org files listed in it.  To speed up the
download, MobileOrg will only read files whose checksums(3) have
changed.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Symbolic links in `org-directory' need to have the same name
than their targets.

   (2) While creating the agendas, Org mode will force ID properties on
all referenced entries, so that these entries can be uniquely
identified if MobileOrg flags them for further action.  If you do not
want to get these properties in so many entries, you can set the
variable `org-mobile-force-id-on-agenda-items' to `nil'.  Org mode will
then rely on outline paths, in the hope that these will be unique
enough.

   (3) Checksums are stored automatically in the file `checksums.dat'


File: org,  Node: Pulling from MobileOrg,  Prev: Pushing to MobileOrg,  Up: MobileOrg

B.3 Pulling from MobileOrg
==========================

When MobileOrg synchronizes with the server, it not only pulls the Org
files for viewing.  It also appends captured entries and pointers to
flagged and changed entries to the file `mobileorg.org' on the server.
Org has a _pull_ operation that integrates this information into an
inbox file and operates on the pointers to flagged entries.  Here is
how it works:

  1. Org moves all entries found in `mobileorg.org'(1) and appends them
     to the file pointed to by the variable
     `org-mobile-inbox-for-pull'.  Each captured entry and each editing
     event will be a top-level entry in the inbox file.

  2. After moving the entries, Org will attempt to implement the
     changes made in MobileOrg.  Some changes are applied directly and
     without user interaction.  Examples are all changes to tags, TODO
     state, headline and body text that can be cleanly applied.
     Entries that have been flagged for further action will receive a
     tag `:FLAGGED:', so that they can be easily found again.  When
     there is a problem finding an entry or applying the change, the
     pointer entry will remain in the inbox and will be marked with an
     error message.  You need to later resolve these issues by hand.

  3. Org will then generate an agenda view with all flagged entries.
     The user should then go through these entries and do whatever
     actions are necessary.  If a note has been stored while flagging
     an entry in MobileOrg, that note will be displayed in the echo
     area when the cursor is on the corresponding agenda line.

    `?'
          Pressing `?' in that special agenda will display the full
          flagging note in another window and also push it onto the
          kill ring.  So you could use `?  z C-y C-c C-c' to store that
          flagging note as a normal note in the entry.  Pressing `?'
          twice in succession will offer to remove the `:FLAGGED:' tag
          along with the recorded flagging note (which is stored in a
          property).  In this way you indicate that the intended
          processing for this flagged entry is finished.

   If you are not able to process all flagged entries directly, you can
always return to this agenda view(2) using `C-c a ?'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) `mobileorg.org' will be empty after this operation.

   (2) Note, however, that there is a subtle difference.  The view
created automatically by `M-x org-mobile-pull RET' is guaranteed to
search all files that have been addressed by the last pull.  This might
include a file that is not currently in your list of agenda files.  If
you later use `C-c a ?' to regenerate the view, only the current agenda
files will be searched.

Appendix C History and acknowledgments
**************************************

C.1 From Carsten
================

Org was born in 2003, out of frustration over the user interface of the
Emacs Outline mode.  I was trying to organize my notes and projects,
and using Emacs seemed to be the natural way to go.  However, having to
remember eleven different commands with two or three keys per command,
only to hide and show parts of the outline tree, that seemed entirely
unacceptable to me.  Also, when using outlines to take notes, I
constantly wanted to restructure the tree, organizing it parallel to my
thoughts and plans.  _Visibility cycling_ and _structure editing_ were
originally implemented in the package `outline-magic.el', but quickly
moved to the more general `org.el'.  As this environment became
comfortable for project planning, the next step was adding _TODO
entries_, basic _timestamps_, and _table support_.  These areas
highlighted the two main goals that Org still has today: to be a new,
outline-based, plain text mode with innovative and intuitive editing
features, and to incorporate project planning functionality directly
into a notes file.

   Since the first release, literally thousands of emails to me or to
<emacs-orgmode@gnu.org> have provided a constant stream of bug reports,
feedback, new ideas, and sometimes patches and add-on code.  Many
thanks to everyone who has helped to improve this package.  I am trying
to keep here a list of the people who had significant influence in
shaping one or more aspects of Org.  The list may not be complete, if I
have forgotten someone, please accept my apologies and let me know.

   Before I get to this list, a few special mentions are in order:

Bastien Guerry
     Bastien has written a large number of extensions to Org (most of
     them integrated into the core by now), including the LaTeX
     exporter and the plain list parser.  His support during the early
     days, when he basically acted as co-maintainer, was central to the
     success of this project.  Bastien also invented Worg, helped
     establishing the Web presence of Org, and sponsored hosting costs
     for the orgmode.org website.

Eric Schulte and Dan Davison
     Eric and Dan are jointly responsible for the Org-babel system,
     which turns Org into a multi-language environment for evaluating
     code and doing literate programming and reproducible research.

John Wiegley
     John has contributed a number of great ideas and patches directly
     to Org, including the attachment system (`org-attach.el'),
     integration with Apple Mail (`org-mac-message.el'), hierarchical
     dependencies of TODO items, habit tracking (`org-habits.el'), and
     encryption (`org-crypt.el').  Also, the capture system is really
     an extended copy of his great `remember.el'.

Sebastian Rose
     Without Sebastian, the HTML/XHTML publishing of Org would be the
     pitiful work of an ignorant amateur.  Sebastian has pushed this
     part of Org onto a much higher level.  He also wrote
     `org-info.js', a Java script for displaying web pages derived from
     Org using an Info-like or a folding interface with single-key
     navigation.

See below for the full list of contributions!  Again, please let me
know what I am missing here!

C.2 From Bastien
================

I (Bastien) have been maintaining Org since January 2011.  This appendix
would not be complete without adding a few more acknowledgements and
thanks to Carsten's ones above.

   I am first grateful to Carsten for his trust while handing me over
the maintainership of Org.  His unremitting support is what really
helped me getting more confident over time, with both the community and
the code.

   When I took over maintainership, I knew I would have to make Org more
collaborative than ever, as I would have to rely on people that are more
knowledgeable than I am on many parts of the code.  Here is a list of
the persons I could rely on, they should really be considered
co-maintainers, either of the code or the community:

Eric Schulte
     Eric is maintaining the Babel parts of Org.  His reactivity here
     kept me away from worrying about possible bugs here and let me
     focus on other parts.

Nicolas Goaziou
     Nicolas is maintaining the consistency of the deepest parts of
     Org.  His work on `org-element.el' and `ox.el' has been
     outstanding, and opened the doors for many new ideas and features.
     He rewrote many of the old exporters to use the new export engine,
     and helped with documenting this major change.  More importantly
     (if that's possible), he has been more than reliable during all
     the work done for Org 8.0, and always very reactive on the mailing
     list.

Achim Gratz
     Achim rewrote the building process of Org, turning some _ad hoc_
     tools into a flexible and conceptually clean process.  He
     patiently coped with the many hiccups that such a change can
     create for users.

Nick Dokos
     The Org mode mailing list would not be such a nice place without
     Nick, who patiently helped users so many times.  It is impossible
     to overestimate such a great help, and the list would not be so
     active without him.

   I received support from so many users that it is clearly impossible
to be fair when shortlisting a few of them, but Org's history would not
be complete if the ones above were not mentioned in this manual.

     for Remember, which are now templates for capture.

   * Pavel Chalmoviansky influenced the agenda treatment of items with
     specified time.

   * Gregory Chernov patched support for Lisp forms into table
     calculations and improved XEmacs compatibility, in particular by
     porting `nouline.el' to XEmacs.

   * Sacha Chua suggested copying some linking code from Planner.

   * Toby S. Cubitt contributed to the code for clock formats.

   * Baoqiu Cui contributed the DocBook exporter.  It has been deleted
     from Org 8.0: you can now export to Texinfo and export the `.texi'
     file to DocBook using `makeinfo'.

     came up with the idea of properties, and that there should be an
     API for them.

   * Nick Dokos tracked down several nasty bugs.

   * Kees Dullemond used to edit projects lists directly in HTML and so
     inspired some of the early development, including HTML export.  He
     also asked for a way to narrow wide table columns.

   * Jason Dunsmore has been maintaining the Org-Mode server at
     Rackspace for several years now.  He also sponsored the hosting
     costs until Rackspace started to host us for free.

     integrating the Org-Babel documentation into the manual.

   * Christian Egli converted the documentation into Texinfo format,
     inspired the agenda, patched CSS formatting into the HTML
     exporter, and wrote `org-taskjuggler.el', which has been rewritten
     by Nicolas Goaziou as `ox-taskjuggler.el' for Org 8.0.

     `org-element.el' and `org-export.el', which was a huge step forward
     in implementing a clean framework for Org exporters.

   * Kai Grossjohann pointed out key-binding conflicts with other
     packages.

   * Brian Gough of Network Theory Ltd publishes the Org mode manual as
     a book.

   * Bernt Hansen has driven much of the support for auto-repeating
     tasks, task state change logging, and the clocktable.  His clear
     explanations have been critical when we started to adopt the Git
     version control system.

   * Manuel Hermenegildo has contributed various ideas, small fixes and
     patches.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
