* Version 8.2

** Incompatible changes

*** Combine org-mac-message.el and org-mac-link-grabber into org-mac-link.el

Please remove calls to =(require 'org-mac-message)= and =(require
'org-mac-link-grabber)= in your =.emacs= initialization file.  All you
need now is =(require 'org-mac-link)=.

Additionally, replace any calls to =ogml-grab-link= to
=org-mac-grab-link=.  For example, replace this line:

: (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-c g") 'omgl-grab-link)

with this:

: (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-c g") 'org-mac-grab-link)

*** HTML export: Replace =HTML_HTML5_FANCY= by =:html-html5-fancy= (...)

Some of the HTML specific export options in Org <8.1 are either nil or
t, like =#+HTML_INCLUDE_STYLE=.  We replaced these binary options with
option keywords like :html-include-style.

So you need to replace

: #+HTML_INCLUDE_STYLE: t

by 

: #+OPTIONS: :html-include-style t

Options affected by this change: =HTML5_FANCY=, =HTML_INCLUDE_SCRIPTS=
and =HTML_INCLUDE_STYLE=.

*** Add an argument to ~org-export-to-file~ and ~org-export-to-buffer~

~org-export-to-file~ and ~org-export-to-file~ can run in a different
process when provided a non-nil =ASYNC= optional argument, without
relying on ~org-export-async-start~ macro.

Since =ASYNC= is the first of optional arguments, you have to shift
the other optional arguments accordingly.

*** Export back-ends are now structures

Export back-ends are now structures, and stored as such in the
communication channel during an export process.  In other words, from
now on, ~(plist-get info :back-end)~ will return a structure instead
of a symbol.

Arguments in hooks and in filters are still symbols, though.

** Important bugfixes

*** [[doc:org-insert-heading][org-insert-heading]] has been rewritten and bugs are now fixed
*** The replacement of disputed keys is now turned of when reading a date

*** Match string for sparse trees can now contain a slash in a property value

    You can now have searches like SOMEPROP="aaa/bbb".  Until now,
    this would break because the slash would be interpreted as the
    separator starting a TOTO match string.
** New features

*** =C-c ^ x= will now sort checklist items by their checked status

See [[doc:org-sort-list][org-sort-list]]: hitting =C-c ^ x= will put checked items at the end
of the list.
*** Various LaTeX export enhancements

- Support SVG images
- Support for .pgf files
- LaTeX Babel blocks can now be exported as =.tikz= files
- Allow =latexmk= as an option for [[doc:org-latex-pdf-process][org-latex-pdf-process]]
- When using =\usepackage[AUTO]{babel}=, AUTO will automatically be
  replaced with a value compatible with ~org-export-default-language~
  or ~LANGUAGE~ keyword.
- The dependency on the =latexsym= LaTeX package has been removed, we
  now use =amssymb= symbols by default instead.

*** New functions for paragraph motion
    
    The commands =C-down= and =C-up= now invoke special commands
    that use knowledge from the org-elements parser to move the cursor
    in a paragraph-like way.

*** New entities in =org-entities.el=
    
Add support for ell, imath, jmath, varphi, varpi, aleph, gimel, beth,
dalet, cdots, S (§), dag, ddag, colon, therefore, because, triangleq,
leq, geq, lessgtr, lesseqgtr, ll, lll, gg, ggg, prec, preceq,
preccurlyeq, succ, succeq, succurlyeq, setminus, nexist(s), mho,
check, frown, diamond.  Changes loz, vert, checkmark, smile and tilde.

*** Anonymous export back-ends

~org-export-create-backend~ can create anonymous export back-ends,
which can then be passed to export functions like
~org-export-to-file~, ~org-export-to-buffer~ or ~org-export-as~.

It allows for quick translation of Org syntax without the overhead of
registering a new back-end.

*** New agenda fortnight view

    The agenda has not, in addition to day, week, month, and year
    views, also a fortnight view covering 14 days.
** New options

*** New option [[doc:org-bookmark-names-plist][org-bookmark-names-plist]]

This allows to specify the names of automatic bookmarks.
*** New option [[doc:org-agenda-ignore-drawer-properties][org-agenda-ignore-drawer-properties]]

This allows more flexibility when optimizing the agenda generation.
See http://orgmode.org/worg/agenda-optimization.html for details.
*** New option: [[doc:org-html-link-use-abs-url][org-html-link-use-abs-url]] to force using absolute URLs

This is an export/publishing option, and should be used either within
the =#+OPTIONS= line(s) or within a [[doc:org-publish-project-alist][org-publish-project-alist]].

Setting this option to =t= is needed when the HTML output does not
allow relative URLs.  For example, the =contrib/lisp/ox-rss.el=
library produces a RSS feed, and RSS feeds need to use absolute URLs,
so a combination of =:html-link-home "..." and :html-link-use-abs-url
t= is required---see the configuration example in the comment section
of =ox-rss.el=.

*** New option [[doc:org-babel-ditaa-java-cmd][org-babel-ditaa-java-cmd]]

This makes java executable configurable for ditaa blocks.

*** New options [[doc:org-babel-latex-htlatex][org-babel-latex-htlatex]] and [[doc:org-babel-latex-htlatex-packages][org-babel-latex-htlatex-packages]]

This enables SVG generation from latex code blocks.

*** New option: [[doc:org-habit-show-done-always-green][org-habit-show-done-always-green]]

See [[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2013-05/msg00214.html][this message]] from Max Mikhanosha.

*** New option: [[doc:org-babel-inline-result-wrap][org-babel-inline-result-wrap]]

If you set this to the following

: (setq org-babel-inline-result-wrap "$%s$")

then inline code snippets will be wrapped into the formatting string.

*** New option: [[doc:org-special-ctrl-o][org-special-ctrl-o]]

    This variable can be used to turn off the special behavior of
    =C-o= in tables.
** New contributed packages

- =ox-bibtex.el= by Nicolas Goaziou :: an utility to handle BibTeX
     export to both LaTeX and HTML exports.  It uses the [[http://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/bibtex2html/][bibtex2html]]
     software.

- =org-screenshot.el= by Max Mikhanosha :: an utility to handle
     screenshots easily from Org, using the external tool [[http://freecode.com/projects/scrot][scrot]].

** Miscellaneous

*** "QUOTE" keywords in headlines are deprecated

"QUOTE" keywords are an undocumented feature in Org.  When a headline
starts with the keyword "QUOTE", its contents are parsed as
a ~quote-section~ and treated as an example block.  You can achieve
the same with example blocks.

This feature is deprecated and will be removed in the next Org
release.

* Version 8.0.1

** Installation

Installation instructions have been updated and simplified.

If you have troubles installing or updating Org, focus on these
instructions:

- when updating via a =.zip/.tar.gz= file, you only need to set the
  =load-path= in your =.emacs=.  Set it before any other Org
  customization that would call autoloaded Org functions.

- when updating by pulling Org's Git repository, make sure to create the
  correct autoloads.  You can do this by running =~$ make autoloads= (to
  only create the autoloads) or by running =~$ make= (to also compile
  the Emacs lisp files.)  =~$ make help= and =~$ make helpall= gives you
  detailed explanations.

- when updating through ELPA (either from GNU ELPA or from Org ELPA),
  you have to install Org's ELPA package in a session where no Org
  function has been called already.
  
When in doubt, run =M-x org-version RET= and see if you have a mixed-up
installation.

See http://orgmode.org/org.html#Installation for details.

** Incompatible changes

Org 8.0 is the most disruptive major version of Org.

If you configured export options, you will have to update some of them.

If you used =#+ATTR_*= keywords, the syntax of the attributes changed and
you will have to update them.

Below is a list of changes for which you need to take action.

See http://orgmode.org/worg/org-8.0.html for the most recent version of
this list and for detailed instructions on how to migrate.

**** New export engine

Org 8.0 comes with a new export engine written by Nicolas Goaziou.  This
export engine relies on ~org-element.el~ (Org's syntax parser), which was
already in Org's core.  This new export engine triggered the rewriting of
/all/ export back-ends.

The most visible change is the export dispatcher, accessible through the
keybinding =C-c C-e=.  By default, this menu only shows some of the
built-in export formats, but you can add more formats by loading them
directly (e.g., =(require 'ox-texinfo)= or by configuring the option
[[doc:org-export-backends][org-export-backends]].

More contributed back-ends are available from the =contrib/= directory, the
corresponding files start with the =ox-= prefix.

If you customized an export back-end (like HTML or LaTeX), you will need to
rename some options so that your customization is not lost.  Typically, an
option starting with =org-export-html-= is now named =org-html-=.  See the
manual for details and check [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-8.0.html][this Worg page]] for directions.

**** New syntax for #+ATTR_HTML/LaTeX/... options

     : #+ATTR_HTML width="200px"

     should now be written

     : #+ATTR_HTML :width 200px

     Keywords like =#+ATTR_HTML= and =#+ATTR_LaTeX= are defined in their
     respective back-ends, and the list of supported parameters depends on
     each backend.  See Org's manual for details.

**** ~org-remember.el~ has been removed

     You cannot use =remember.el= anymore to capture notes.

     Support for remember templates has been obsoleted since long, it is
     now fully removed.

     Use =M-x org-capture-import-remember-templates RET= to import your
     remember templates into capture templates.

**** ~org-jsinfo.el~ has been merged into ~ox-html.el~

     If you were requiring ~ox-jsinfo.el~ in your ~.emacs.el~ file, you
     will have to remove this requirement from your initialization file.

**** Note for third-party developers

     The name of the files for export back-end have changed: we now use the
     prefix =ox-= for those files (like we use the =ob-= prefix for Babel
     files.)  For example ~org-html.el~ is now ~ox-html.el~.

     If your code relies on these files, please update the names in your
     code.

**** Packages moved from core to contrib

     Since packages in Org's core are meant to be part of GNU Emacs, we try
     to be minimalist when it comes to adding files into core.  For 8.0, we
     moved some contributions into the =contrib/= directory.

     The rationale for deciding that these files should live in =contrib/=
     is either because they rely on third-party software that is not
     included in Emacs, or because they are not targeting a significant
     user-base.

     - org-colview-xemacs.el
     - org-mac-message.el
     - org-mew.el
     - org-wl.el
     - ox-freedmind.el
     - ox-taskjuggler.el

     Note that ~ox-freedmind.el~ has been rewritten by Jambunathan,
     ~org-mew.el~ has been enhanced by Tokuya Kameshima and
     ~ox-taskjuggler.el~ by Nicolas Goaziou and others.

     Also, the Taskjuggler exporter now uses TJ3 by default.  John Hendy
     wrote [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-taskjuggler3.html][a tutorial on Worg]] for the TJ3 export.

** New packages in core

*** ~ob-makefile.el~ by Eric Schulte and Thomas S. Dye

    =ob-makefile.el= implements Org Babel support for Makefile tangling.

*** ~ox-man.el~ by Luis Anaya

    =ox-man.el= allows you to export Org files to =man= pages.

*** ~ox-md.el~ by Nicolas Goaziou

    =ox-md.el= allows you to export Org files to Markdown files, using the
    vanilla [[http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/][Markdown syntax]].

*** ~ox-texinfo.el~ by Jonathan Leech-Pepin

    =ox-texinfo.el= allows you to export Org files to [[http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/][Texinfo]] files.

** New packages in contrib

*** ~ob-julia.el~ by G. Jay Kerns

    [[http://julialang.org/][Julia]] is a new programming language.

    =ob-julia.el= provides Org Babel support for evaluating Julia source
    code.

*** ~ob-mathomatic.el~ by Luis Anaya

    [[http://www.mathomatic.org/][mathomatic]] a portable, command-line, educational CAS and calculator
    software, written entirely in the C programming language.

    ~ob-mathomatic.el~ provides Org Babel support for evaluating mathomatic
    entries.

*** ~ob-tcl.el~ by Luis Anaya

    ~ob-tcl.el~ provides Org Babel support for evaluating [[http://www.tcl.tk/][Tcl]] source code.

*** ~org-bullets.el~ by Evgeni Sabof

    Display bullets instead of stars for headlines.

    Also see [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.html#sec-8-12][this updated FAQ]] on how to display another character than "*"
    for starting headlines.

*** ~org-favtable.el~ by Marc-Oliver Ihm

    ~org-favtable.el~ helps you to create and update a table of favorite
    locations in org, keeping the most frequently visited lines right at
    the top.  This table is called "favtable".  See the documentation on
    [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-favtable.html][Worg]].

*** ~ox-confluence.el~ by Sébastien Delafond

    ~ox-confluence.el~ lets you convert Org files to [[https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence%2BWiki%2BMarkup][Confluence Wiki]] files.

*** ~ox-deck.el~ and ~ox-s5.el~ by Rick Frankel

    [[http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/][deck.js]] is a javascript library for displaying HTML ages as
    presentations.  ~ox-deck.el~ exports Org files to HTML presentations
    using =deck.js=.

    [[http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/][s5]] is a set of scripts which also allows to display HTML pages as
    presentations.  ~ox-s5.el~ exports Org files to HTML presentations
    using =s5=.

*** ~ox-groff.el~ by Luis Anaya and Nicolas Goaziou

    The [[http://www.gnu.org/software/groff/][groff]] (GNU troff) software is a typesetting package which reads
    plain text mixed with formatting commands and produces formatted
    output.

    Luis Anaya and Nicolas Goaziou implemented ~ox-groff.el~ to allow
    conversion from Org files to groff.

*** ~ox-koma-letter.el~ by Nicolas Goaziou and Alan Schmitt

    This back-end allow to export Org pages to the =KOMA Scrlttr2= format.

*** ~ox-rss.el~ by Bastien

    This back-end lets you export Org pages to RSS 2.0 feeds.  Combined
    with the HTML publishing feature, this allows you to build a blog
    entirely with Org.

** New features

*** Export

**** New export generic options

If you use Org exporter, we advise you to re-read [[http://orgmode.org/org.html#Exporting][the manual section about
it]].  It has been updated and includes new options.

Among the new/updated export options, three are of particular importance:

- [[doc:org-export-allow-bind-keywords][org-export-allow-bind-keywords]] :: This option replaces the old option
     =org-export-allow-BIND= and the default value is =nil=, not =confirm=.
     You will need to explicitly set this to =t= in your initialization
     file if you want to allow =#+BIND= keywords.

- [[doc:org-export-with-planning][org-export-with-planning]] :: This new option controls the export of
     =SCHEDULED:, DEADLINE:, CLOSED:= lines, and planning information is
     now skipped by default during export.  This use to be the job of
     [[doc:org-export-with-timestamps][org-export-with-timestamps]], but this latter option has been given a
     new role: it controls the export of /standalone time-stamps/.  When
     set to =nil=, Org will not export active and inactive time-stamps
     standing on a line by themselves or within a paragraph that only
     contains time-stamps.

To check if an option has been introduced or its default value changed in
Org 8.0, do =C-h v [option] RET= and check if the documentation says that
the variable has been introduced (or changed) in version 24.4 of Emacs.

**** Enhanced default stylesheet for the HTML exporter

See the new default value of [[doc:org-html-style-default][org-html-style-default]].

**** New tags, classes and ids for the HTML exporter

See the new default value of [[doc:org-html-divs][org-html-divs]].

**** Support for tikz pictures in LaTeX export
**** ~org-man.el~: New export function for "man" links
**** ~org-docview.el~: New export function for docview links
*** Structure editing

**** =C-u C-u M-RET= inserts a heading at the end of the parent subtree
**** Cycling to the =CONTENTS= view keeps inline tasks folded

[[doc:org-cycle-hook][org-cycle-hook]] as a new function [[doc:org-cycle-hide-inline-tasks][org-cycle-hide-inline-tasks]] which
prevents the display of inline tasks when showing the content of a subtree.

**** =C-c -= in a region makes a list item for each line

This is the opposite of the previous behavior, where =C-c -= on a region
would create one item for the whole region, and where =C-u C-c -= would
create an item for each line.  Now =C-c -= on the selected region creates
an item per line, and =C-u C-c -= creates a single item for the whole
region.

**** When transposing words, markup characters are now part of the words

In Emacs, you can transpose words with =M-t=.  Transposing =*these*
_words__= will preserve markup.

**** New command [[doc:org-set-property-and-value][org-set-property-and-value]] bound to =C-c C-x P=

This command allows you to quickly add both the property and its value.  It
is useful in buffers where there are many properties and where =C-c C-x p=
can slow down the flow of editing too much.

**** New commands [[doc:org-next-block][org-next-block]] and [[doc:org-previous-block][org-previous-block]]

These commands allow you to go to the previous block (=C-c M-b= or the
speedy key =B=) or to the next block (=C-c M-f= or the speedy key =F=.)

**** New commands [[doc:org-drag-line-forward][org-drag-line-forward]] and [[doc:org-drag-line-backward][org-drag-line-backward]]

These commands emulate the old behavior of =M-<down>= and =M-<up>= but are
now bound to =S-M-<down>= and =S-M-<up>= respectively, since =M-<down>= and
=M-<up>= now drag the whole element at point (a paragraph, a table, etc.)
forward and backward.

**** When a list item has a checkbox, inserting a new item uses a checkbox too
**** When sorting entries/items, only the description of links is considered

Now Org will sort this list

: - [[http://abc.org][B]]
: - [[http://def.org][A]]

like this:

: - [[http://def.org][A]]
: - [[http://abc.org][B]]

by comparing the descriptions, not the links.
Same when sorting headlines instead of list items.
**** New option =orgstruct-heading-prefix-regexp=

For example, setting this option to "^;;; " in Emacs lisp files and using
=orgstruct-mode= in those files will allow you to cycle through visibility
states as if lines starting with ";;; *..." where headlines.

In general, you want to set =orgstruct-heading-prefix-regexp= as a file
local variable.

**** New behavior of [[doc:org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift][org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift]]

The default is now to ask for a time-shift only when there is a time-stamp.
When called with a universal prefix argument =C-u=, it will not ask for a
time-shift even if there is a time-stamp.

**** New option [[doc:org-agenda-restriction-lock-highlight-subtree][org-agenda-restriction-lock-highlight-subtree]]

This defaults to =t= so that the whole subtree is highlighted when you
restrict the agenda view to it with =C-c C-x <= (or the speed command =<=).
The default setting helps ensuring that you are not adding tasks after the
restricted region.  If you find this highlighting too intrusive, set this
option to =nil=.
**** New option [[doc:org-closed-keep-when-no-todo][org-closed-keep-when-no-todo]]

When switching back from a =DONE= keyword to a =TODO= keyword, Org now
removes the =CLOSED= planning information, if any.  It also removes this
information when going back to a non-TODO state (e.g., with =C-c C-t SPC=).
If you want to keep the =CLOSED= planning information when removing the
TODO keyword, set [[doc:org-closed-keep-when-no-todo][org-closed-keep-when-no-todo]] to =t=.

**** New option [[doc:org-image-actual-width][org-image-actual-width]]

This option allows you to change the width of in-buffer displayed images.
The default is to use the actual width of the image, but you can use a
fixed value for all images, or fall back on an attribute like

: #+attr_html: :width 300px
*** Scheduled/deadline

**** Implement "delay" cookies for scheduled items

If you want to delay the display of a scheduled task in the agenda, you can
now use a delay cookie like this: =SCHEDULED: <2004-12-25 Sat -2d>=.  The
task is still scheduled on the 25th but will appear in your agenda starting
from two days later (i.e. from March 27th.)

Imagine for example that your co-workers are not done in due time and tell
you "we need two more days".  In that case, you may want to delay the
display of the task in your agenda by two days, but you still want the task
to appear as scheduled on March 25th.

In case the task contains a repeater, the delay is considered to affect all
occurrences; if you want the delay to only affect the first scheduled
occurrence of the task, use =--2d= instead.  See [[doc:org-scheduled-delay-days][org-scheduled-delay-days]]
and [[doc:org-agenda-skip-scheduled-delay-if-deadline][org-agenda-skip-scheduled-delay-if-deadline]] for details on how to
control this globally or per agenda.

**** Use =C-u C-u C-c C-s= will insert a delay cookie for scheduled tasks

See the previous section for why delay cookies may be useful.

**** Use =C-u C-u C-c C-d= will insert a warning delay for deadline tasks

=C-u C-u C-c C-d= now inserts a warning delay to deadlines.
*** Calendar, diary and appts

**** New variable [[doc:org-read-date-minibuffer-local-map][org-read-date-minibuffer-local-map]]

By default, this new local map uses "." to go to today's date, like in the
normal =M-x calendar RET=.  If you want to deactivate this and to reassign
the "@" key to =calendar-goto-today=, use this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Unbind "." in Org's calendar:
  (define-key org-read-date-minibuffer-local-map (kbd ".") nil)

  ;; Bind "@" to `calendar-goto-today':
  (define-key org-read-date-minibuffer-local-map
              (kbd "@")
              (lambda () (interactive) (org-eval-in-calendar '(calendar-goto-today))))
#+END_SRC

**** In Org's calendar, =!= displays diary entries of the date at point

This is useful when you want to check if you don't already have an
appointment when setting new ones with =C-c .= or =C-c s=.  =!= will
call =diary-view-entries= and display the diary in a separate buffer.

**** [[doc:org-diary][org-diary]]: only keep the descriptions of links

[[doc:org-diary][org-diary]] returns diary information from Org files, but it returns it
in a diary buffer, not in an Org mode buffer.  When links are displayed,
only show their description, not the full links.
*** Agenda

**** New agenda type =agenda*= and entry types =:scheduled* :deadline*=

When defining agenda custom commands, you can now use =agenda*=: this will
list entries that have both a date and a time.  This is useful when you
want to build a list of appointments.

You can also set [[doc:org-agenda-entry-types][org-agenda-entry-types]] either globally or locally in
each agenda custom command and use =:timestamp*= and/or =:deadline*= there.

Another place where this is useful is your =.diary= file:

: %%(org-diary :scheduled*) ~/org/rdv.org

This will list only entries from =~/org/rdv.org= that are scheduled with a
time value (i.e. appointments).

**** New agenda sorting strategies

[[doc:org-agenda-sorting-strategy][org-agenda-sorting-strategy]] allows these new sorting strategies:

| Strategy       | Explanations                             |
|----------------+------------------------------------------|
| timestamp-up   | Sort by any timestamp, early first       |
| timestamp-down | Sort by any timestamp, late first        |
| scheduled-up   | Sort by scheduled timestamp, early first |
| scheduled-down | Sort by scheduled timestamp, late first  |
| deadline-up    | Sort by deadline timestamp, early first  |
| deadline-down  | Sort by deadline timestamp, late first   |
| ts-up          | Sort by active timestamp, early first    |
| ts-down        | Sort by active timestamp, late first     |
| tsia-up        | Sort by inactive timestamp, early first  |
| tsia-down      | Sort by inactive timestamp, late first   |

**** New options to limit the number of agenda entries

You can now limit the number of entries in an agenda view.  This is
different from filters: filters only /hide/ the entries in the agenda,
while limits are set while generating the list of agenda entries.

These new options are available:

- [[doc:org-agenda-max-entries][org-agenda-max-entries]] :: limit by number of entries.
- [[doc:org-agenda-max-todos][org-agenda-max-todos]] :: limit by number of TODOs.
- [[doc:org-agenda-max-tags][org-agenda-max-tags]] :: limit by number of tagged entries.
- [[doc:org-agenda-max-effort][org-agenda-max-effort]] :: limit by effort (minutes).

For example, if you locally set [[doc:org-agenda-max-todos][org-agenda-max-todos]] to 3 in an agenda
view, the agenda will be limited to the first three todos.  Other entries
without a TODO keyword or beyond the third TODO headline will be ignored.

When setting a limit (e.g. about an effort's sum), the default behavior is
to exclude entries that cannot be checked against (e.g. entries that have
no effort property.)  To include other entries too, you can set the limit
to a negative number.  For example =(setq org-agenda-max-tags -3)= will not
show the fourth tagged headline (and beyond), but it will also show
non-tagged headlines.

**** =~= in agenda view sets temporary limits

You can hit =~= in the agenda to temporarily set limits: this will
regenerate the agenda as if the limits were set.  This is useful for
example when you want to only see a list of =N= tasks, or a list of tasks
that take only =N= minutes.

**** "=" in agenda view filters by regular expressions

You can now filter agenda entries by regular expressions using ~=~.  =C-u
== will filter entries out.  Regexp filters are cumulative.  You can set
[[doc:org-agenda-regexp-filter-preset][org-agenda-regexp-filter-preset]] to suit your needs in each agenda view.

**** =|= in agenda view resets all filters

Since it's common to combine tag filters, category filters, and now regexp
filters, there is a new command =|= to reset all filters at once.

**** Allow writing an agenda to an =.org= file

You can now write an agenda view to an =.org= file.  It copies the
headlines and their content (but not subheadings) into the new file.

This is useful when you want to quickly share an agenda containing the full
list of notes.

**** New commands to drag an agenda line forward (=M-<down>=) or backward (=M-<up>=)

It sometimes handy to move agenda lines around, just to quickly reorganize
your tasks, or maybe before saving the agenda to a file.  Now you can use
=M-<down>= and =M-<up>= to move the line forward or backward.

This does not persist after a refresh of the agenda, and this does not
change the =.org= files who contribute to the agenda.

**** Use =%b= for displaying "breadcrumbs" in the agenda view

[[doc:org-agenda-prefix-format][org-agenda-prefix-format]] now allows to use a =%b= formatter to tell Org
to display "breadcrumbs" in the agenda view.

This is useful when you want to display the task hierarchy in your agenda.

**** Use =%l= for displaying the headline's level in the agenda view

[[doc:org-agenda-prefix-format][org-agenda-prefix-format]] allows to use a =%l= formatter to tell Org to
display entries with additional spaces corresponding to their level in the
outline tree.

**** [[doc:org-agenda-write][org-agenda-write]] will ask before overwriting an existing file

=M-x org-agenda-write RET= (or =C-c C-w= from an agenda buffer) used to
overwrite preexisting file with the same name without confirmation.  It now
asks for a confirmation.

**** New commands =M-m= and =M-*= to toggle (all) mark(s) for bulk action

- [[doc:org-agenda-bulk-toggle][org-agenda-bulk-toggle]] :: this command is bound to =M-m= and toggles
     the mark of the entry at point.

- [[doc:org-agenda-bulk-toggle-all][org-agenda-bulk-toggle-all]] :: this command is bound to =M-*= and
     toggles all the marks in the current agenda.

**** New option [[doc:org-agenda-search-view-max-outline-level][org-agenda-search-view-max-outline-level]]

This option sets the maximum outline level to display in search view.
E.g. when this is set to 1, the search view will only show headlines of
level 1.

**** New option [[doc:org-agenda-todo-ignore-time-comparison-use-seconds][org-agenda-todo-ignore-time-comparison-use-seconds]]

This allows to compare times using seconds instead of days when honoring
options like =org-agenda-todo-ignore-*= in the agenda display.

**** New option [[doc:org-agenda-entry-text-leaders][org-agenda-entry-text-leaders]]

This allows you to get rid of the ">" character that gets added in front of
entries excerpts when hitting =E= in the agenda view.

**** New formatting string for past deadlines in [[doc:org-agenda-deadline-leaders][org-agenda-deadline-leaders]]

The default formatting for past deadlines is ="%2d d. ago: "=, which makes
it explicit that the deadline is in the past.  You can configure this via
[[doc:org-agenda-deadline-leaders][org-agenda-deadline-leaders]].  Note that the width of the formatting
string is important to keep the agenda alignment clean.

**** New allowed value =repeated-after-deadline= for [[doc:org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-deadline-is-shown][org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-deadline-is-shown]]

When [[doc:org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-deadline-is-shown][org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-deadline-is-shown]] is set to
=repeated-after-deadline=, the agenda will skip scheduled items if they are
repeated beyond the current deadline.

**** New option for [[doc:org-agenda-skip-deadline-prewarning-if-scheduled][org-agenda-skip-deadline-prewarning-if-scheduled]]

This variable may be set to nil, t, the symbol `pre-scheduled', or a number
which will then give the number of days before the actual deadline when the
prewarnings should resume.  The symbol `pre-scheduled' eliminates the
deadline prewarning only prior to the scheduled date.

Read the full docstring for details.

**** [[doc:org-class][org-class]] now supports holiday strings in the skip-weeks parameter

For example, this task will now be skipped only on new year's day:

    : * Task
    :   <%%(org-class 2012 1 1 2013 12 12 2 "New Year's Day")>
*** Capture

**** Allow =C-1= as a prefix for [[doc:org-agenda-capture][org-agenda-capture]] and [[doc:org-capture][org-capture]]

With a =C-1= prefix, the capture mechanism will use the =HH:MM= value at
point (if any) or the current =HH:MM= time as the default time for the
capture template.

**** Expand keywords within %(sexp) placeholder in capture templates

If you use a =%:keyword= construct within a =%(sexp)= construct, Org will
expand the keywords before expanding the =%(sexp)=.

**** Allow to contextualize capture (and agenda) commands by checking the name of the buffer

[[doc:org-capture-templates-contexts][org-capture-templates-contexts]] and [[doc:org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts][org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts]]
allow you to define what capture templates and what agenda commands should
be available in various contexts.  It is now possible for the context to
check against the name of the buffer.
*** Tag groups

Using =#+TAGS: { Tag1 : Tag2 Tag3 }= will define =Tag1= as a /group tag/
(note the colon after =Tag1=).  If you search for =Tag1=, it will return
headlines containing either =Tag1=, =Tag2= or =Tag3= (or any combination
of those tags.)

You can use group tags for sparse tree in an Org buffer, for creating
agenda views, and for filtering.

See http://orgmode.org/org.html#Tag-groups for details.

*** Links

**** =C-u C-u M-x org-store-link RET= will ignore non-core link functions

Org knows how to store links from Org buffers, from info files and from
other Emacs buffers.  Org can be taught how to store links from any buffer
through new link protocols (see [[http://orgmode.org/org.html#Adding-hyperlink-types]["Adding hyperlink types"]] in the manual.)

Sometimes you want Org to ignore added link protocols and store the link
as if the protocol was not known.

You can now do this with =C-u C-u M-x org-store-link RET=.

**** =C-u C-u C-u M-x org-store-link RET= on an active region will store links for each lines

Imagine for example that you want to store a link for every message in a
Gnus summary buffer.  In that case =C-x h C-u C-u C-u M-x org-store-link
RET= will store a link for every line (i.e. message) if the region is
active.

**** =C-c C-M-l= will add a default description for links which don't have one

=C-c C-M-l= inserts all stored links.  If a link does not have a
description, this command now adds a default one, so that we are not mixing
with-description and without-description links when inserting them.

**** No curly braces to bracket links within internal links

When storing a link to a headline like

: * See [[http://orgmode.org][Org website]]

[[doc:org-store-link][org-store-link]] used to convert the square brackets into curly brackets.
It does not anymore, taking the link description or the link path, when
there is no description.
*** Table

**** Switching between #+TBLFM lines

If you have several =#+TBLFM= lines below a table, =C-c C-c= on a line will
apply the formulas from this line, and =C-c C-c= on another line will apply
those other formulas.

**** You now use "nan" for empty fields in Calc formulas

If empty fields are of interest, it is recommended to reread the section
[[http://orgmode.org/org.html#Formula-syntax-for-Calc][3.5.2 Formula syntax for Calc]] of the manual because the description for the
mode strings has been clarified and new examples have been added towards
the end.

**** Handle localized time-stamps in formulas evaluation

If your =LOCALE= is set so that Org time-stamps use another language than
english, and if you make time computations in Org's table, it now works by
internally converting the time-stamps with a temporary =LOCALE=C= before
doing computation.

**** New lookup functions

There are now three lookup functions:

- [[doc:org-loopup-first][org-loopup-first]]
- [[doc:org-loopup-last][org-loopup-last]]
- [[doc:org-loopup-all][org-loopup-all]]

See [[http://orgmode.org/org.html#Lookup-functions][the manual]] for details.
*** Startup keywords

These new startup keywords are now available:

| Startup keyword                  | Option                                      |
|----------------------------------+---------------------------------------------|
| =#+STARTUP: logdrawer=           | =(setq org-log-into-drawer t)=              |
| =#+STARTUP: nologdrawer=         | =(setq org-log-into-drawer nil)=            |
|----------------------------------+---------------------------------------------|
| =#+STARTUP: logstatesreversed=   | =(setq org-log-states-order-reversed t)=    |
| =#+STARTUP: nologstatesreversed= | =(setq org-log-states-order-reversed nil)=  |
|----------------------------------+---------------------------------------------|
| =#+STARTUP: latexpreview=        | =(setq org-startup-with-latex-preview t)=   |
| =#+STARTUP: nolatexpreview=      | =(setq org-startup-with-latex-preview nil)= |

*** Clocking

**** New option [[doc:org-clock-rounding-minutes][org-clock-rounding-minutes]]

E.g. if [[doc:org-clock-rounding-minutes][org-clock-rounding-minutes]] is set to 5, time is 14:47 and you
clock in: then the clock starts at 14:45.  If you clock out within the next
5 minutes, the clock line will be removed; if you clock out 8 minutes after
your clocked in, the clock out time will be 14:50.

**** New option [[doc:org-time-clocksum-use-effort-durations][org-time-clocksum-use-effort-durations]]

When non-nil, =C-c C-x C-d= uses effort durations.  E.g., by default, one
day is considered to be a 8 hours effort, so a task that has been clocked
for 16 hours will be displayed as during 2 days in the clock display or in
the clocktable.

See [[doc:org-effort-durations][org-effort-durations]] on how to set effort durations and
[[doc:org-time-clocksum-format][org-time-clocksum-format]] for more on time clock formats.

**** New option [[doc:org-clock-x11idle-program-name][org-clock-x11idle-program-name]]

This allows to set the name of the program which prints X11 idle time in
milliseconds.  The default is to use =x11idle=.

**** New option [[doc:org-use-last-clock-out-time-as-effective-time][org-use-last-clock-out-time-as-effective-time]]

When non-nil, use the last clock out time for [[doc:org-todo][org-todo]].  Note that this
option has precedence over the combined use of [[doc:org-use-effective-time][org-use-effective-time]] and
[[doc:org-extend-today-until][org-extend-today-until]].

**** =S-<left/right>= on a clocksum column will update the sum by updating the last clock
**** =C-u 3 C-S-<up/down>= will update clock timestamps synchronously by 3 units
**** New parameter =:wstart= for clocktables to define the week start day
**** New parameter =:mstart= to state the starting day of the month
**** Allow relative times in clocktable tstart and tend options
**** The clocktable summary is now a caption
**** =:tstart= and =:tend= and friends allow relative times like "<-1w>" or "<now>"
*** Babel

**** You can now use =C-c C-k= for [[doc:org-edit-src-abort][org-edit-src-abort]]

This allows you to quickly cancel editing a source block.

**** =C-u C-u M-x org-babel-tangle RET= tangles by the target file of the block at point

This is handy if you want to tangle all source code blocks that have the
same target than the block at point.

**** New options for auto-saving the base buffer or the source block editing buffer

When [[doc:org-edit-src-turn-on-auto-save][org-edit-src-turn-on-auto-save]] is set to =t=, editing a source block
in a new window will turn on =auto-save-mode= and save the code in a new
file under the same directory than the base Org file.

When [[doc:org-edit-src-auto-save-idle-delay][org-edit-src-auto-save-idle-delay]] is set to a number of minutes =N=,
the base Org buffer will be saved after this number of minutes of idle
time.

**** New =:post= header argument post-processes results

     This header argument may be used to pass the results of the current
     code block through another code block for post-processing.  See the
     manual for a usage example.

**** Commented out heading are ignored when collecting blocks for tangling

If you comment out a heading (with =C-c ;= anywhere on the heading or in
the subtree), code blocks from within this heading are now ignored when
collecting blocks for tangling.

**** New option [[doc:org-babel-hash-show-time][org-babel-hash-show-time]] to show a time-stamp in the result hash
**** Do not ask for confirmation if cached value is current

Do not run [[doc:org-babel-confirm-evaluate][org-babel-confirm-evaluate]] if source block has a cache and the
cache value is current as there is no evaluation involved in this case.
**** =ob-sql.el= and =ob-python.el= have been improved.
**** New Babel files only need to =(require 'ob)=

When writing a new Babel file, you now only need to use =(require 'ob)=
instead of requiring each Babel library one by one.
*** Faces

- Org now fontifies radio link targets by default
- In the agenda, use [[doc:org-todo-keyword-faces][org-todo-keyword-faces]] to highlight selected TODO keywords
- New face [[doc:org-priority][org-priority]], enhanced fontification of priority cookies in agenda

** Outside Org

*** Spanish translation of the Org guide by David Arroyo Menéndez

David (and others) translated the Org compact guide in spanish:

You can read the [[http://orgmode.org/worg/orgguide/orgguide.es.pdf][PDF guide]].

*** ~poporg.el~ and ~outorg.el~

Two new libraries (~poporg.el~ by François Pinard and ~outorg.el~ by
Thorsten Jolitz) now enable editing of comment-sections from source-code
buffers in temporary Org-mode buffers, making the full editing power of
Org-mode available.  ~outorg.el~ comes together with ~outshine.el~ and
~navi-mode.el~, two more libraries by Thorsten Jolitz with the goal to give
source-code buffers the /look & feel/ of Org-mode buffers while greatly
improving navigation and structure editing.  A detailed description can be
found here: http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-outside-org.html

Here are two screencasts demonstrating Thorsten's tools:

- [[http://youtu.be/nqE6YxlY0rw]["Modern conventions for Emacs Lisp files"]]
- [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DII-xYw5VGFM][Exploring Bernt Hansen's Org-mode tutorial with 'navi-mode']]

*** MobileOrg for iOS

MobileOrg for iOS back in the App Store The 1.6.0 release was focused on
the new Dropbox API and minor bug fixes but also includes a new ability to
launch in Capture mode.  Track development and contribute [[https://github.com/MobileOrg/mobileorg/issues][on github]].

* Version 7.9.3

** New option [[doc::org-agenda-use-tag-inheritance][org-agenda-use-tag-inheritance]]

[[doc::org-use-tag-inheritance][org-use-tag-inheritance]] controls whether tags are inherited when
org-tags-view is called (either in =tags=, =tags-tree= or =tags-todo=
agenda views.)

When generating other agenda types such as =agenda=, =todo= and
=todo-tree=, tags inheritance is not used when selecting the entries
to display.  Still, you might want to have all tag information correct
in the agenda buffer, e.g. for tag filtering.  In that case, add the
agenda type to this variable.

Setting this variable to nil should considerably speeds up the agenda
generation.

Note that the default was to display inherited tags in the agenda
lines even if `org-use-tag-inheritance' was nil.  The default is now
to *never* display inherited tags in agenda lines, but to /know/ about
them when the agenda type is listed in [[doc::org-agenda-use-tag-inheritance][org-agenda-use-tag-inheritance]].

** New default value nil for [[doc::org-agenda-dim-blocked-tasks][org-agenda-dim-blocked-tasks]]

Using `nil' as the default value speeds up the agenda generation.  You
can hit `#' (or `C-u #') in agenda buffers to temporarily dim (or turn
invisible) blocked tasks.

** New speedy keys for [[doc::org-speed-commands-default][org-speed-commands-default]]

You can now use `:' (instead of `;') for setting tags---this is
consistent with using the `:' key in agenda view.

You can now use `=' for [[doc::org-columns][org-columns]].

** =org-float= is now obsolete, use =diary-float= instead
** No GPL manual anymore

There used to be a GPL version of the Org manual, but this is not the
case anymore, the Free Software Foundation does not permit this.

The GNU FDL license is now included in the manual directly.

** Enhanced compatibility with Emacs 22 and XEmacs

Thanks to Achim for his work on enhancing Org's compatibility with
various Emacsen.  Things may not be perfect, but Org should work okay
in most environments.

* Version 7.9.2

** New ELPA repository for Org packages

You can now add the Org ELPA repository like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/") t)
#+END_SRC

It contains both the =org-*.tar= package (the core Org distribution, also
available through http://elpa.gnu.org) and the =org-plus*.tar= package (the
extended Org distribution, with non-GNU packages from the =contrib/=
directory.)

See http://orgmode.org/elpa/

** Overview of the new keybindings

   | Keybinding      | Speedy | Command                     |

** New package and Babel language

*** =org-eshell.el= by Konrad Hinsen is now in Org

    =org-eshell.el= allows you to create links from [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eshell/index.html][Eshell]].

*** Support for execution of Scala code blocks (see ob-scala.el)
*** Support for execution of IO code blocks (see ob-io.el)

** Incompatible changes

   - If your code relies on =org-write-agenda=, please use
     [[doc::org-agenda-write][org-agenda-write]] from now on.

   - If your code relies on =org-make-link=, please use =concat=
     instead.

   - =org-link-to-org-use-id= has been renamed to
     =org-id-link-to-org-use-id= and its default value is nil.  The
     previous default was =create-if-interactive-and-no-custom-id=.

** New features and user-visible changes

*** Org Element

    =org-element.el= is a toolbox for parsing and analyzing "elements"
    in an Org-mode buffer.  This has been written by Nicolas Goaziou
    and has been tested for quite some time.  It is now part of Org's
    core and many core functions rely on this package.

    Two functions might be particularly handy for users:
    =org-element-at-point= and =org-element-context=.

    See the docstrings for more details.

    Below is a list of editing and navigating commands that now rely
    on =org-element.el=.

**** [[doc::org-fill-paragraph][org-fill-paragraph]] has been completely rewritten

     The filling mechanisms now rely on org-element, trying to do the
     right thing on each element in various contexts.  E.g. filling in
     a list item will preserve indentation; filling in message-mode
     will fall back on the relevant filling functions; etc.

**** [[doc::org-metaup][org-metaup]] and [[doc::org-metadown][org-metadown]] will drag the element backward/forward

     If you want to get the old behavior (i.e. moving a line up and
     down), you can first select the line as an active region, then
     =org-metaup= or =org-metadown= to move the region backward or
     forward.  This also works with regions bigger than just one line.

**** [[doc::org-up-element][org-up-element]] and [[doc::org-down-element][org-down-element]] (respectively =C-c C-^= and =C-c C-_=)

     This will move the point up/down in the hierarchy of elements.

**** [[doc::org-backward-element][org-backward-element]] and [[doc::org-forward-element][org-forward-element]] (respectively =M-{= and =M-}=)

     This will move the point backward/forward in the hierarchy of
     elements.

**** [[doc::org-narrow-to-element][org-narrow-to-element]] will narrow to the element at point
**** [[doc::org-mark-element][org-mark-element]] will mark the element at point

     This command is bound to =M-h= and will mark the element at
     point.  If the point is at a paragraph, it will mark the
     paragraph.  If the point is at a list item, it will mark the list
     item.  Etc.

     Note that if point is at the beginning of a list, it will mark
     the whole list.

     To mark a subtree, you can either use =M-h= on the headline
     (since there is no ambiguity about the element you're at) or
     [[doc::org-mark-subtree][org-mark-subtree]] (=C-c @=) anywhere in the subtree.

     Invoking [[doc::org-mark-element][org-mark-element]] repeatedly will try to mark the next
     element on top of the previous one(s).  E.g. hitting =M-h= twice
     on a headline will mark the current subtree and the next one on
     the same level.

*** Org Agenda

**** New option [[doc::org-agenda-sticky][org-agenda-sticky]]

     There is a new option =org-agenda-sticky= which enables "sticky"
     agendas.  Sticky agendas remain opened in the background so that
     you don't need to regenerate them each time you hit the
     corresponding keystroke.  This is a big time saver.

     When [[doc::org-agenda-sticky][org-agenda-sticky]] is =non-nil=, the agenda buffer will be
     named using the agenda key and its description.  In sticky
     agendas, the =q= key will just bury the agenda buffers and
     further agenda commands will show existing buffer instead of
     generating new ones.

     If [[doc::org-agenda-sticky][org-agenda-sticky]] is set to =nil=, =q= will kill the single
     agenda buffer.

**** New option [[doc::org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts][org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts]]

     Setting this option allows you to define specific context where
     agenda commands should be available from.  For example, when set
     to this value

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts
        '(("p" (in-file . "\\.txt"))))
#+END_SRC

     then the =p= agenda command will only be available from buffers
     visiting *.txt files.  See the docstring and the manual for more
     details on how to use this.

**** Changes in bulk actions

     The set of commands starting with =k ...= as been deleted and the
     features have been merged into the "bulk action" feature.

     After you marked some entries in the agenda, if you call =B s=,
     the agenda entries will be rescheduled using the date at point if
     on a date header.  If you are on an entry with a timestamp, you
     will be prompted for a date to reschedule your marked entries to,
     using the timestamp at point as the default prompt.

     You can now use =k= to capture the marked entry and use the date
     at point as an overriding date for the capture template.

     To bind this behavior to =M-x org-capture RET= (or its
     keybinding), set the new option [[doc::org-capture-use-agenda-date][org-capture-use-agenda-date]] to
     =t=.

**** =N= and =P= in the agenda will move to the next/previous item

**** New command [[doc::org-agenda-bulk-mark-all][org-agenda-bulk-mark-all]] to mark all items

     This new command is bound to =*= in agenda mode.

     There is also a new option [[doc::org-agenda-bulk-mark-char][org-agenda-bulk-mark-char]] to set the
     character to use as a mark for bulk actions.

**** New option [[doc::org-agenda-persistent-marks][org-agenda-persistent-marks]]

     When set to =non-nil=, marks will remain visible after a bulk
     action.  You can temporarily toggle this by pressing =p= when
     invoking [[doc::org-agenda-bulk-action][org-agenda-bulk-action]].  Marks are deleted if your
     rebuild the agenda buffer or move to another date/span (e.g. with
     =f= or =w=).

**** New option [[doc::org-agenda-skip-timestamp-if-deadline-is-shown][org-agenda-skip-timestamp-if-deadline-is-shown]]

     =Non-nil= means skip timestamp line if same entry shows because
     of deadline.

     In the agenda of today, an entry can show up multiple times
     because it has both a plain timestamp and has a nearby deadline.
     When this variable is t, then only the deadline is shown and the
     fact that the entry has a timestamp for or including today is not
     shown.  When this variable is =nil=, the entry will be shown
     several times.

**** New =todo-unblocked= and =nottodo-unblocked= skip conditions

     See the [[http://orgmode.org/w/?p%3Dorg-mode.git%3Ba%3Dcommit%3Bh%3Df426da][git commit]] for more explanations.

**** Allow category filtering in the agenda

     You can now filter the agenda by category.  Pressing "<" will
     filter by the category of the item on the current line, and
     pressing "<" again will remove the filter.  You can combine tag
     filters and category filters.

     You can use =org-agenda-category-filter= in your custom agenda
     views and =org-agenda-category-filter-preset= in your main
     configuration.

     See also the new command [[doc::org-agenda-filter-by-top-category][org-agenda-filter-by-top-category]]:
     hitting =^= will filter by "Top" category: only show entries that
     are of the same category than the Top category of the entry at
     point.

*** Org Links

**** Inserting links

     When inserting links through [[doc::org-insert-link][org-insert-link]], the description is
     now displayed first, followed by the literal link, as the
     description is often more useful when you look for the link you
     want to insert.

     Completion now complete both literal links and description.  If
     you complete a description, the literal link and its description
     will be inserted directly, whereas when you complete the literal
     link, you will be prompted for a description (as with Org 7.8.)

     In the completion buffer, links to the current buffer are now
     highlighted.

**** New templates =%h= and =%(sexp)= for abbreviated links

     On top of =%s= template, which is replaced by the link tag in
     abbreviated links, you can now use =%h= (which does the same than =%s=
     but does not hexify the tag) and =%(sexp)= (which can run a function
     that takes the tag as its own argument.)

**** New link type =help=

     You can now create links from =help= buffers.

     For example, if you request help for the command [[doc::org-agenda][org-agenda]] with
     =C-h f org-agenda RET=, creating a link from this buffer will let
     you go back to the same buffer.

**** New command [[doc::org-insert-all-links][org-insert-all-links]]

     This will insert all links as list items.  With a universal
     prefix argument, links will not be deleted from the variable
     =org-stored-links=.

     This new command is bound to =C-c C-M-l=.

**** New option [[doc::org-url-hexify-p][org-url-hexify-p]]

     When set to =nil=, the =URL= part of a link will not be hexified.

**** Org can now open multiple shell links

**** New option [[doc::org-doi-server-url][org-doi-server-url]] to specify an alternate DOI server

**** RET now follows time stamps links

*** Org Editing

**** [[doc::org-todo][org-todo]] and =org-archive-*= can now loop in the active region

     When [[doc::org-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region][org-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region]] is =non-nil=, using
     [[doc::org-todo][org-todo]] or =org-archive-*= commands in the active region will
     loop over headlines.  This is handy if you want to set the TODO
     keyword for several items, or archive them quickly.

**** You can now set tags for headlines in a region

     If [[doc::org-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region][org-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region]] is =non-nil=, then
     selecting the region and hitting =C-c C-q= will set the tags for
     all headlines in the region.

**** New command [[doc::org-insert-drawer][org-insert-drawer]] to insert a drawer interactively

**** Comments start with "^[ \t]*# " anywhere on a line

     Note that the space after the hashtag is mandatory.  Comments
     with "^#+" are not supported anymore.

**** New speed key =#= to toggle the COMMENT cookie on a headline

**** =indent-region-function= is now set to [[doc::org-indent-region][org-indent-region]]

     =C-M-\= should now produce useful results.

     You can unindent the buffer with [[doc::org-unindent-buffer][org-unindent-buffer]].

**** New option [[doc::org-allow-promoting-top-level-subtree][org-allow-promoting-top-level-subtree]]

     When =non-nil=, =S-M-<left>= will promote level-1 subtrees
     containing other subtrees.  The level-1 headline will be
     commented out.  You can revert to the previous state with =M-x
     undo RET=.

*** Org Clock

**** New keybinding =C-c C-x C-z= for [[doc::org-clock-resolve][org-clock-resolve]]

**** New keybinding =C-c C-x C-q= for [[doc::org-clock-cancel][org-clock-cancel]]

**** New command [[doc::org-clock-in-last][org-clock-in-last]] to clock in the last clocked item

     This command is bound to =C-c C-x C-x= and will clock in the last
     clocked entry, if any.

**** =C-u M-x= [[doc::org-clock-out][org-clock-out]] =RET= now prompts for a state to switch to

**** =S-M-<up/down>= on a clock timestamps adjusts the previous/next clock

**** New option [[doc::org-clock-continuously][org-clock-continuously]]

     When set to =nil=, clocking in a task will first try to find the
     last clocked out task and restart from when that task was clocked
     out.

     You can temporarily activate continuous clocking with =C-u C-u
     C-u M-x= [[doc::org-clock-in][org-clock-in]] =RET= (three universal prefix arguments)
     and =C-u C-u M-x= [[org-clock-in-last][org-clock-in-last]] =RET= (two universal prefix
     arguments).


**** New option [[doc::org-clock-frame-title-format][org-clock-frame-title-format]]

     This option sets the value of =frame-title-format= when clocking
     in.

**** New options for controlling the clockreport display

     [[doc::org-clock-file-time-cell-format][org-clock-file-time-cell-format]]: Format string for the file time
     cells in clockreport.

     [[doc::org-clock-total-time-cell-format][org-clock-total-time-cell-format]]: Format string for the total
     time cells in clockreport.


**** New options for controlling the clock/timer display

     [[doc::org-clock-clocked-in-display][org-clock-clocked-in-display]]: control whether the current clock
     is displayed in the mode line and/or frame title.

     [[doc::org-timer-display][org-timer-display]]: control whether the current timer is displayed
     in the mode line and/or frame title.

     This allows the clock and timer to be displayed in the frame
     title instead of, or as well as, the mode line.  This is useful
     for people with limited space in the mode line but with ample
     space in the frame title.

*** Org Appearance

**** New option [[doc::org-custom-properties][org-custom-properties]]

     The visibility of properties listed in this options can be turn
     on/off with [[doc::org-toggle-custom-properties-visibility][org-toggle-custom-properties-visibility]].  This might
     be useful for properties used by third-part tools or that you
     don't want to see temporarily.

**** New command [[doc::org-redisplay-inline-images][org-redisplay-inline-images]]

     This will redisplay all images.  It is bound to =C-c C-x C-M-v=.

**** New entities in =org-entities.el=

     There are these new entities:

     : ("tilde" "\\~{}" nil "&tilde;" "~" "~" "~")
     : ("slash" "/" nil "/" "/" "/" "/")
     : ("plus" "+" nil "+" "+" "+" "+")
     : ("under" "\\_" nil "_" "_" "_" "_")
     : ("equal" "=" nil "=" "=" "=" "=")
     : ("asciicirc" "\\textasciicircum{}" nil "^" "^" "^" "^")

**** New face =org-list-dt= for definition terms
**** New face =org-date-selected= for the selected calendar day
**** New face value for =org-document-title=

     The face is back to a normal height.

*** Org Columns

**** New speed command =:= to activate the column view
**** New special property =CLOCKSUM_T= to display today's clocked time

     You can use =CLOCKSUM_T= the same way you use =CLOCKSUM=.  It
     will display the time spent on tasks for today only.

**** Use the =:COLUMNS:= property in columnview dynamic blocks

     If the =:COLUMNS:= is set in a subtree, the columnview dynamic
     block will use its value as the column format.

**** Consider inline tasks when computing a sum

*** Org Dates and Time Stamps

**** Enhanced [[doc::org-sparse-tree][org-sparse-tree]]

     =C-c /= can now check for time ranges.

     When checking for dates with =C-c /= it is useful to change the
     type of dates that you are interested in.  You can now do this
     interactively with =c= after =C-c /= and/or by setting
     [[doc::org-sparse-tree-default-date-type][org-sparse-tree-default-date-type]] to the default value you want.

**** Support for hourly repeat cookies

     You can now use

     : SCHEDULED: <2012-08-20 lun. 08:00 +1h>

     if you want to add an hourly repeater to an entry.

**** =C-u C-u C-c .= inserts a time-stamp with no prompt

**** When (setq [[doc::org-read-date-prefer-future][org-read-date-prefer-future]] 'time), accept days in the prompt

     "8am Wed" and "Wed 8am" are now acceptable values when entering a
     date from the prompt.  If [[doc::org-read-date-prefer-future][org-read-date-prefer-future]] is set to
     =time=, this will produce the expected prompt indication.

**** New option [[doc::org-datetree-add-timestamp][org-datetree-add-timestamp]]

     When set to =non-nil=, datetree entries will also have a
     timestamp.  This is useful if you want to see these entries in a
     sparse tree with =C-c /=.

*** Org Capture

**** New command [[doc::org-capture-string][org-capture-string]]

     M-x [[doc::org-capture-string][org-capture-string]] RET will prompt for a string and a capture
     template.  The string will be used as an annotation for the
     template.  This is useful when capturing in batch mode as it lets
     you define the content of the template without being in Emacs.

**** New option [[doc::org-capture-templates-contexts][org-capture-templates-contexts]]

     Setting this option allows you to define specific context where
     capture templates should be available from.  For example, when
     set to this value

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-capture-templates-contexts
        '(("c" (in-mode . "message-mode"))))
#+END_SRC

     then the =c= capture template will only be available from
     =message-mode= buffers.  See the docstring and the manual for
     more details on how to use this.

**** New =%l= template to insert the literal link
**** New option [[doc::org-capture-bookmark][org-capture-bookmark]]

     Org used to automatically add a bookmark with capture a note.
     You can now turn this on by setting [[doc::org-capture-bookmark][org-capture-bookmark]] to
     =nil=.

**** Expand =%<num>= escape sequences into text entered for <num>'th =%^{PROMPT}= escape

     See the manual for more explanations.

**** More control over empty lines

     You can use =:empty-lines-before= and =:empty-lines-after= to
     control the insertion of empty lines.  Check the manual for more
     explanations.

**** New hook [[doc::org-capture-prepare-finalize-hook][org-capture-prepare-finalize-hook]]

     This new hook runs before the finalization process starts.

*** Org Export

**** New functions =orgtbl-to-table.el= and =orgtbl-to-unicode=

     =orgtbl-to-table.el= convert the table to a =table.el= table, and
     =orgtbl-to-unicode= will use =ascii-art-to-unicode.el= (when
     available) to print beautiful tables.

**** [[doc::org-table-export][org-table-export]] now a bit clever about the target format

     When you specify a file name like =table.csv=, [[doc::org-table-export][org-table-export]]
     will now suggest =orgtbl-to-csv= the default method for exporting
     the table.

**** New option [[doc::org-export-date-timestamp-format][org-export-date-timestamp-format]]

     The option allows to set a time string format for Org timestamps
     in the #+DATE option.

**** LaTeX: New options for exporting table rules :tstart, :hline and :tend

     See [[doc::org-export-latex-tables-hline][org-export-latex-tables-hline]] and [[doc::org-export-latex-tables-tend][org-export-latex-tables-tend]].

**** LaTeX: You can now set =:hfmt= from =#+ATTR_LaTeX=
**** Beamer: Add support and keybinding for the =exampleblock= environment

     Add support for these languages in [[doc::org-export-language-setup][org-export-language-setup]].
     More languages are always welcome.

**** Beamer: New option [[doc::org-beamer-inherited-properties][org-beamer-inherited-properties]]

     This option allows Beamer export to inherit some properties.
     Thanks to Carsten for implementing this.

**** ODT: Add support for ODT export in org-bbdb.el
**** ODT: Add support for indented tables (see [[http://orgmode.org/w/?p%3Dorg-mode.git%3Ba%3Dcommit%3Bh%3De9fd33][this commit]] for details)
**** ODT: Improve the conversion from ODT to other formats
**** ASCII: Swap the level-1/level-2 characters to underline the headlines
**** Support for Chinese, simplified Chinese, Russian, Ukrainian and Japanese
**** HTML: New option [[doc::org-export-html-date-format-string][org-export-html-date-format-string]]

     Format string to format the date and time in HTML export.  Thanks
     to Sébastien Vauban for this patch.

*** Org Babel

**** New =:results drawer= parameter

=:results drawer= replaces =:results wrap=, which is deprecated but still
supported.

**** =:results org= now put results in a =#+BEGIN_SRC org= block

=:results org= used to put results in a =#+BEGIN_ORG= block but it now puts
results in a =#+BEGIN_SRC org= block, with comma-escaped lines.

=#+BEGIN_ORG= blocks are obsolete.

**** Exporting =#+BEGIN_SRC org= blocks exports the code

It used to exports the results of the code.

*** Miscellaneous

**** New menu entry for [[doc::org-refile][org-refile]]
**** Allow capturing to encrypted entries

If you capture to an encrypted entry, it will be decrypted before
inserting the template then re-encrypted after finalizing the capture.

**** Inactive timestamps are now handled in tables

Calc can do computation on active time-stamps like <2012-09-29 sat.>.
Inactive time-stamps in a table's cell are now internally deactivated so
that Calc formulas can operate on them.

**** [[doc::org-table-number-regexp][org-table-number-regexp]] can now accept comma as decimal mark
**** Org allows a new property =APPT_WARNTIME=

     You can set it with the =W= speedy key or set it manually.  When
     set, exporting to iCalendar and [[doc::org-agenda-to-appt][org-agenda-to-appt]] will use the
     value of this property as the number of minutes for the warning
     alarm.

**** New command [[doc::org-inc-effort][org-inc-effort]]

     This will increment the effort value.

     It is bound to =C-c C-x E= and to =E= as a speedy command.

**** Attach: Add support for creating symbolic links

     =org-attach-method= now supports a new method =lns=, allowing to
     attach symbolic links.

**** Archive: you can now archive to a datetree

**** New option [[doc::org-inlinetask-show-first-star][org-inlinetask-show-first-star]]

     =Non-nil= means display the first star of an inline task as
     additional marker.  When =nil=, the first star is not shown.

**** New option [[doc::org-latex-preview-ltxpng-directory][org-latex-preview-ltxpng-directory]]

     This lets you define the path for the =ltxpng/= directory.

**** You can now use imagemagick instead of dvipng to preview LaTeX fragments
**** You can now turn off [[doc::orgstruct++-mode][orgstruct++-mode]] safely
**** =C-u C-c C-c= on list items to add check boxes

     =C-u C-c C-c= will add an empty check box on a list item.

     When hit from the top of the list, it will add check boxes for
     all top level list items.

**** =org-list-ending-method= and =org-list-end-regexp= are now obsolete

     Fall back on using =org-list-end-re= only, which see.

**** org-feed.el now expands =%(sexp)= templates
**** New option [[doc::org-protocol-data-separator][org-protocol-data-separator]]

**** New option [[doc::org-ditaa-jar-option][org-ditaa-jar-option]] to specify the ditaa jar file

**** New possible value for [[doc::org-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region][org-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region]]

     When [[doc::org-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region][org-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region]] is set to
     =start-level=, the command will loop over the active region but
     will only act upon entries that are of the same level than the
     first headline in the region.

**** New option [[doc::org-habit-show-all-today][org-habit-show-all-today]]

     When set to =t=, show all (even unscheduled) habits on today's
     agenda.

** Important bug fixes

*** M-TAB on options keywords perform completion correctly again

    If you hit =M-TAB= on keywords like =#+TITLE=, Org will try to
    perform completion with meaningful values.

*** Add licenses to javascript embedded and external code snippets

    Embedded javascript code produced when exporting an Org file to
    HTML is now licensed under GPLv3 (or later), and the copyright is
    owned by the Free Software Foundation, Inc.

    The javascript code for embedding MathJax in the browser mentions
    the MathJax copyright and the Apache 2.0 license.

    The javascript code for embedding =org-injo.js= in the browser
    mentions the copyright of Sebastian Rose and the GPLv3 (or later)
    license.

    =org-export-html-scripts= is now a variable, so that you can adapt
    the code and the license to your needs.

    See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html for
    explanations on why these changes were necessary.

* Version 7.8.11

** Incompatible changes

*** Emacs 21 support has been dropped

    Do not use Org mode 7.xx with Emacs 21, use [[http://orgmode.org/org-6.36c.zip][version 6.36c]] instead.

*** XEmacs support requires the XEmacs development version

    To use Org mode 7.xx with XEmacs, you need to run the developer
    version of XEmacs.  We were about to drop XEmacs support entirely,
    but Michael Sperber stepped in and made changes to XEmacs that
    made it easier to keep the support.  Thanks to Michael for this
    last-minute save.

*** New keys for TODO sparse trees

    The key =C-c C-v= is now reserved for Org Babel action.  TODO
    sparse trees can still be made with =C-c / t= (all not-done
    states) and =C-c / T= (specific states).

*** The Agenda =org-agenda-ndays= is now obsolete

    The variable =org-agenda-ndays= is obsolete - please use
    =org-agenda-span= instead.

    Thanks to Julien Danjou for this.

*** Changes to the intended use of =org-export-latex-classes=

    So far this variable has been used to specify the complete header
    of the LaTeX document, including all the =\usepackage= calls
    necessary for the document.  This setup makes it difficult to
    maintain the list of packages that Org itself would like to call,
    for example for the special symbol support it needs.

    First of all, you can *opt out of this change* in the following
    way: You can say: /I want to have full control over headers, and I
    will take responsibility to include the packages Org needs/.  If
    that is what you want, add this to your configuration and skip the
    rest of this section (except maybe for the description of the
    =[EXTRA]= place holder):

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (setq org-export-latex-default-packages-alist nil
         org-export-latex-packages-alist nil)
    #+end_src

    /Continue to read here if you want to go along with the modified
    setup./

    There are now two variables that should be used to list the LaTeX
    packages that need to be included in all classes.  The header
    definition in =org-export-latex-classes= should then not contain
    the corresponding =\usepackage= calls (see below).

    The two new variables are:

    1. =org-export-latex-default-packages-alist= :: This is the
         variable where Org-mode itself puts the packages it needs.
         Normally you should not change this variable.  The only
         reason to change it anyway is when one of these packages
         causes a conflict with another package you want to use.  Then
         you can remove that packages and hope that you are not using
         Org-mode functionality that needs it.

    2. =org-export-latex-packages-alist= :: This is the variable where
         you can put the packages that you'd like to use across all
         classes.

    The sequence how these customizations will show up in the LaTeX
    document are:

    1. Header from =org-export-latex-classes=
    2. =org-export-latex-default-packages-alist=
    3. =org-export-latex-packages-alist=
    4. Buffer-specific things set with =#+LaTeX_HEADER:=

    If you want more control about which segment is placed where, or
    if you want, for a specific class, have full control over the
    header and exclude some of the automatic building blocks, you can
    put the following macro-like place holders into the header:

    #+begin_example
    [DEFAULT-PACKAGES]      \usepackage statements for default packages
    [NO-DEFAULT-PACKAGES]   do not include any of the default packages
    [PACKAGES]              \usepackage statements for packages
    [NO-PACKAGES]           do not include the packages
    [EXTRA]                 the stuff from #+LaTeX_HEADER
    [NO-EXTRA]              do not include #+LaTeX_HEADER stuff
    #+end_example

    If you have currently customized =org-export-latex-classes=, you
    should revise that customization and remove any package calls that
    are covered by =org-export-latex-default-packages-alist=.  This
    applies to the following packages:

    - inputenc
    - fontenc
    - fixltx2e
    - graphicx
    - longtable
    - float
    - wrapfig
    - soul
    - t1enc
    - textcomp
    - marvosym
    - wasysym
    - latexsym
    - amssymb
    - hyperref

    If one of these packages creates a conflict with another package
    you are using, you can remove it from
    =org-export-latex-default-packages-alist=.  But then you risk that
    some of the advertised export features of Org will not work
    properly.

    You can also consider moving packages that you use in all classes
    to =org-export-latex-packages-alist=.  If necessary, put the place
    holders so that the packages get loaded in the right sequence.  As
    said above, for backward compatibility, if you omit the place
    holders, all the variables will dump their content at the end of
    the header.

*** The constant =org-html-entities= is obsolete

    Its content is now part of the new constant =org-entities=, which
    is defined in the file org-entities.el.  =org-html-entities= was
    an internal variable, but it is possible that some users did write
    code using it.

*** =org-bbdb-anniversary-format-alist= has changed

    Please check the docstring and update your settings accordingly.

*** Deleted =org-mode-p=

    This function has been deleted: please update your code.

** Important new features

*** New Org to ODT exporter

    Jambunathan's Org to ODT exporter is now part of Org.

    To use it, it `C-c C-e o' in an Org file.  See the documentation
    for more information on how to customize it.

*** org-capture.el is now the default capture system

    This replaces the earlier system org-remember.  The manual only
    describes org-capture, but for people who prefer to continue to
    use org-remember, we keep a static copy of the former manual
    section [[http://orgmode.org/org-remember.pdf][chapter about remember]].

    The new system has a technically cleaner implementation and more
    possibilities for capturing different types of data.  See
    [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/26441/focus%3D26441][Carsten's announcement]] for more details.

    To switch over to the new system:

    1. Run

     : M-x org-capture-import-remember-templates RET

       to get a translated version of your remember templates into the
       new variable =org-capture-templates=.  This will "mostly" work,
       but maybe not for all cases.  At least it will give you a good
       place to modify your templates.  After running this command,
       enter the customize buffer for this variable with

     : M-x customize-variable RET org-capture-templates RET

       and convince yourself that everything is OK.  Then save the
       customization.

    2. Bind the command =org-capture= to a key, similar to what you did
       with org-remember:

     : (define-key global-map "\C-cc" 'org-capture)

       If your fingers prefer =C-c r=, you can also use this key once
       you have decided to move over completely to the new
       implementation.  During a test time, there is nothing wrong
       with using both system in parallel.

** New libraries

*** New Org libraries
**** org-eshell.el (Konrad Hinsen)

     Implement links to eshell buffers.

**** org-special-blocks (Carsten Dominik)

     This package generalizes the #+begin_foo and #+end_foo tokens.

     To use, put the following in your init file:

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(require 'org-special-blocks)
#+END_EXAMPLE

     The tokens #+begin_center, #+begin_verse, etc. existed
     previously.  This package generalizes them (at least for the
     LaTeX and html exporters).  When a #+begin_foo token is
     encountered by the LaTeX exporter, it is expanded
     into \begin{foo}.  The text inside the environment is not
     protected, as text inside environments generally is.
     When #+begin_foo is encountered by the html exporter, a div with
     class foo is inserted into the HTML file.  It is up to the user
     to add this class to his or her stylesheet if this div is to mean
     anything.

**** org-taskjuggler.el (Christian Egli)

     Christian Egli's /org-taskjuggler.el/ module is now part of Org.
     He also wrote a [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-taskjuggler.php][tutorial]] for it.

**** org-ctags.el (Paul Sexton)

     Targets like =<<my target>>= can now be found by Emacs' etag
     functionality, and Org-mode links can be used to to link to
     etags, also in non-Org-mode files.  For details, see the file
     /org-ctags.el/.

     This feature uses a new hook =org-open-link-functions= which will
     call function to do something special with text links.

     Thanks to Paul Sexton for this contribution.

**** org-docview.el (Jan Böcker)

     This new module allows links to various file types using docview, where
     Emacs displays images of document pages.  Docview link types can point
     to a specific page in a document, for example to page 131 of the
     Org-mode manual:

     : [[docview:~/.elisp/org/doc/org.pdf::131][Org-Mode Manual]]

     Thanks to Jan Böcker for this contribution.

*** New Babel libraries

- ob-picolisp.el (Thorsten Jolitz)
- ob-fortran.el (Sergey Litvinov)
- ob-shen.el (Eric Schulte)
- ob-maxima.el (Eric S Fraga)
- ob-java.el (Eric Schulte)
- ob-lilypond.el (Martyn Jago)
- ob-awk.el (Eric Schulte)

** Other new features and various enhancements

*** Hyperlinks

**** Org-Bibtex -- major improvements

     Provides support for managing bibtex bibliographical references
     data in headline properties.  Each headline corresponds to a
     single reference and the relevant bibliographic meta-data is
     stored in headline properties, leaving the body of the headline
     free to hold notes and comments.  Org-bibtex is aware of all
     standard bibtex reference types and fields.

     The key new functions are

     - org-bibtex-check :: queries the user to flesh out all required
          (and with prefix argument optional) bibtex fields available
          for the specific reference =type= of the current headline.

     - org-bibtex-create :: Create a new entry at the given level,
          using org-bibtex-check to flesh out the relevant fields.

     - org-bibtex-yank :: Yank a bibtex entry on the kill ring as a
          formatted Org-mode headline into the current buffer

     - org-bibtex-export-to-kill-ring :: Export the current headline
          to the kill ring as a formatted bibtex entry.

**** org-gnus.el now allows link creation from messages

     You can now create links from messages.  This is particularly
     useful when the user wants to stored messages that he sends, for
     later check.  Thanks to Ulf Stegemann for the patch.

**** Modified link escaping

     David Maus worked on `org-link-escape'.  See [[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/37888][his message]]:

     : Percent escaping is used in Org mode to escape certain characters
     : in links that would either break the parser (e.g. square brackets
     : in link target oder description) or are not allowed to appear in
     : a particular link type (e.g. non-ascii characters in a http:
     : link).
     :
     : With this change in place Org will apply percent escaping and
     : unescaping more consistently especially for non-ascii characters.
     : Additionally some of the outstanding bugs or glitches concerning
     : percent escaped links are solved.

     Thanks a lot to David for this work.

**** Make =org-store-link= point to directory in a dired buffer

     When, in a dired buffer, the cursor is not in a line listing a
     file, `org-store-link' will store a link to the directory.

     Patch by Stephen Eglen.

**** Allow regexps in =org-file-apps= to capture link parameters

     The way extension regexps in =org-file-apps= are handled has
     changed.  Instead of matching against the file name, the regexps
     are now matched against the whole link, and you can use grouping
     to extract link parameters which you can then use in a command
     string to be executed.

     For example, to allow linking to PDF files using the syntax
     =file:/doc.pdf::<page number>=, you can add the following entry
     to org-file-apps:

     #+begin_example
     Extension: \.pdf::\([0-9]+\)\'
     Command:   evince "%s" -p %1
     #+end_example

     Thanks to Jan Böcker for a patch to this effect.

*** Dates and time

**** Allow relative time when scheduling/adding a deadline

     You can now use relative duration strings like "-2d" or "++3w"
     when calling =org-schedule= or =org-deadline=: it will schedule
     (or set the deadline for) the item respectively two days before
     today and three weeks after the current timestamp, if any.

     You can use this programmatically: =(org-schedule nil "+2d")=
     will work on the current entry.

     You can also use this while (bulk-)rescheduling and
     (bulk-)resetting the deadline of (several) items from the agenda.

     Thanks to Memnon Anon for a heads up about this!

**** American-style dates are now understood by =org-read-date=

     So when you are prompted for a date, you can now answer like this

     #+begin_example
     2/5/3         --> 2003-02-05
     2/5           --> <CURRENT-YEAR>-02-05
     #+end_example

*** Agenda

**** =org-agenda-custom-commands= has a default value

     This option used to be `nil' by default.  This now has a default
     value, displaying an agenda and all TODOs.  See the docstring for
     details.  Thanks to Carsten for this.

**** Improved filtering through =org-agenda-to-appt=

     The new function allows the user to refine the scope of entries
     to pass to =org-agenda-get-day-entries= and allows to filter out
     entries using a function.

     Thanks to Peter Münster for raising a related issue and to
     Tassilo Horn for this idea.  Also thanks to Peter Münster for
     [[git:68ffb7a7][fixing a small bug]] in the final implementation.

**** Allow ap/pm times in agenda time grid

     Times in the agenda can now be displayed in am/pm format.  See
     the new variable =org-agenda-timegrid-use-ampm=.  Thanks to
     C. A. Webber for a patch to this effect.

**** Agenda: Added a bulk "scattering" command

     =B S= in the agenda buffer will cause tasks to be rescheduled a
     random number of days into the future, with 7 as the default.
     This is useful if you've got a ton of tasks scheduled for today,
     you realize you'll never deal with them all, and you just want
     them to be distributed across the next N days.  When called with
     a prefix arg, rescheduling will avoid weekend days.

     Thanks to John Wiegley for this.

*** Exporting

**** Simplification of org-export-html-preamble/postamble

     When set to `t', export the preamble/postamble as usual, honoring
     the =org-export-email/author/creator-info= variables.

     When set to a formatting string, insert this string.  See the
     docstring of these variable for details about available
     %-sequences.

     You can set =:html-preamble= in publishing project in the same
     way: `t' means to honor =:email/creator/author-info=, and a
     formatting string will insert a string.

**** New exporters to Latin-1 and UTF-8

     While Ulf Stegemann was going through the entities list to
     improve the LaTeX export, he had the great idea to provide
     representations for many of the entities in Latin-1, and for all
     of them in UTF-8.  This means that we can now export files rich
     in special symbols to Latin-1 and to UTF-8 files.  These new
     exporters can be reached with the commands =C-c C-e n= and =C-c
     C-e u=, respectively.

     When there is no representation for a given symbol in the
     targeted coding system, you can choose to keep the TeX-macro-like
     representation, or to get an "explanatory" representation.  For
     example, =\simeq= could be represented as "[approx. equal to]".
     Please use the variable =org-entities-ascii-explanatory= to state
     your preference.

**** HTML export: Add class to outline containers using property

     The =HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS= property can now be used to add a
     class name to the outline container of a node in HTML export.

**** Throw an error when creating an image from a LaTeX snippet fails

     This behavior can be configured with the new option variable
     =org-format-latex-signal-error=.

**** Support for creating BEAMER presentations from Org-mode documents

     Org-mode documents or subtrees can now be converted directly in
     to BEAMER presentation.  Turning a tree into a simple
     presentations is straight forward, and there is also quite some
     support to make richer presentations as well.  See the [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Beamer-class-export.html#Beamer-class-export][BEAMER
     section]] in the manual for more details.

     Thanks to everyone who has contributed to the discussion about
     BEAMER support and how it should work.  This was a great example
     for how this community can achieve a much better result than any
     individual could.

*** Refiling

**** Refile targets can now be cached

     You can turn on caching of refile targets by setting the variable
     =org-refile-use-cache=.  This should speed up refiling if you
     have many eligible targets in many files.  If you need to update
     the cache because Org misses a newly created entry or still
     offers a deleted one, press =C-0 C-c C-w=.

**** New logging support for refiling

     Whenever you refile an item, a time stamp and even a note can be
     added to this entry.  For details, see the new option
     =org-log-refile=.

     Thanks to Charles Cave for this idea.

*** Completion

**** In-buffer completion is now done using John Wiegley's pcomplete.el

     Thanks to John Wiegley for much of this code.

*** Tables

**** New command =org-table-transpose-table-at-point=

     See the docstring.  This hack from Juan Pechiar is now part of
     Org's core.  Thanks to Juan!

**** Display field's coordinates when editing it with =C-c `=

     When editing a field with =C-c `=, the field's coordinate will
     the displayed in the buffer.

     Thanks to Michael Brand for a patch to this effect.

**** Spreadsheet computation of durations and time values

     If you want to compute time values use the =T= flag, either in
     Calc formulas or Elisp formulas:

     | Task 1 | Task 2 |   Total |
     |--------+--------+---------|
     |  35:00 |  35:00 | 1:10:00 |
     #+TBLFM: @2$3=$1+$2;T

     Values must be of the form =[HH:]MM:SS=, where hours are
     optional.

     Thanks to Martin Halder, Eric Schulte and Carsten for code and
     feedback on this.

**** Implement formulas applying to field ranges

     Carsten implemented this field-ranges formulas.

     : A frequently requested feature for tables has been to be able to define
     : row formulas in a way similar to column formulas.  The patch below allows
     : things like
     :
     : @3=
     : @2$2..@5$7=
     : @I$2..@II$4=
     :
     : as the left hand side for table formulas in order to write a formula that
     : is valid for an entire column or for a rectangular section in a
     : table.

     Thanks a lot to Carsten for this.

**** Sending radio tables from org buffers is now allowed

     Org radio tables can no also be sent inside Org buffers.  Also,
     there is a new hook which get called after a table has been sent.

     Thanks to Seweryn Kokot.

*** Lists

**** Improved handling of lists

     Nicolas Goaziou extended and improved the way Org handles lists.

     1. Indentation of text determines again end of items in
        lists. So, some text less indented than the previous item
        doesn't close the whole list anymore, only all items more
        indented than it.

     2. Alphabetical bullets are implemented, through the use of the
        variable `org-alphabetical-lists'. This also adds alphabetical
        counters like [@c] or [@W].

     3. Lists can now safely contain drawers, inline tasks, or various
        blocks, themselves containing lists. Two variables are
        controlling this: `org-list-forbidden-blocks', and
        `org-list-export-context'.

     4. Improve `newline-and-indent' (C-j): used in an item, it will
        keep text from moving at column 0. This allows to split text
        and make paragraphs and still not break the list.

     5. Improve `org-toggle-item' (C-c -): used on a region with
        standard text, it will change the region into one item. With a
        prefix argument, it will fallback to the previous behavior and
        make every line in region an item. It permits to easily
        integrate paragraphs inside a list.

     6. `fill-paragraph' (M-q) now understands lists. It can freely be
        used inside items, or on text just after a list, even with no
        blank line around, without breaking list structure.

     Thanks a lot to Nicolas for all this!

*** Inline display of linked images

    Images can now be displayed inline.  The key C-c C-x C-v does
    toggle the display of such images.  Note that only image links
    that have no description part will be inlined.

*** Implement offsets for ordered lists

    If you want to start an ordered plain list with a number different
    from 1, you can now do it like this:

    : 1. [@start:12] will star a lit a number 12

*** Babel: code block body expansion for table and preview

    In org-babel, code is "expanded" prior to evaluation. I.e. the
    code that is actually evaluated comprises the code block contents,
    augmented with the extra code which assigns the referenced data to
    variables. It is now possible to preview expanded contents, and
    also to expand code during during tangling. This expansion takes
    into account all header arguments, and variables.

    A new keybinding `C-c M-b p' bound to `org-babel-expand-src-block'
    can be used from inside of a source code block to preview its
    expanded contents (which can be very useful for debugging).
    tangling

    The expanded body can now be tangled, this includes variable
    values which may be the results of other source-code blocks, or
    stored in headline properties or tables. One possible use for this
    is to allow those using org-babel for their emacs initialization
    to store values (e.g. usernames, passwords, etc...) in headline
    properties or in tables.

    Org-babel now supports three new header arguments, and new default
    behavior for handling horizontal lines in tables (hlines), column
    names, and rownames across all languages.

*** Editing Convenience and Appearance

**** New command =org-copy-visible= (=C-c C-x v=)

     This command will copy the visible text in the region into the
     kill ring.  Thanks to Florian Beck for this function and to
     Carsten for adding it to org.el and documenting it!

**** Make it possible to protect hidden subtrees from being killed by =C-k=

     See the new variable =org-ctrl-k-protect-subtree=.  This was a
     request by Scott Otterson.

**** Implement pretty display of entities, sub-, and superscripts.

     The command =C-c C-x \= toggles the display of Org's special
     entities like =\alpha= as pretty unicode characters.  Also, sub
     and superscripts are displayed in a pretty way (raised/lower
     display, in a smaller font).  If you want to exclude sub- and
     superscripts, see the variable
     =org-pretty-entities-include-sub-superscripts=.

     Thanks to Eric Schulte and Ulf Stegeman for making this possible.

**** New faces for title, date, author and email address lines

     The keywords in these lines are now dimmed out, and the title is
     displayed in a larger font, and a special font is also used for
     author, date, and email information.  This is implemented by the
     following new faces:

     =org-document-title=
     =org-document-info=
     =org-document-info-keyword=

     In addition, the variable =org-hidden-keywords= can be used to
     make the corresponding keywords disappear.

     Thanks to Dan Davison for this feature.

**** Simpler way to specify faces for tags and todo keywords

     The variables =org-todo-keyword-faces=, =org-tag-faces=, and
     =org-priority-faces= now accept simple color names as
     specifications.  The colors will be used as either foreground or
     background color for the corresponding keyword.  See also the
     variable =org-faces-easy-properties=, which governs which face
     property is affected by this setting.

     This is really a great simplification for setting keyword faces.
     The change is based on an idea and patch by Ryan Thompson.

**** <N> in tables now means fixed width, not maximum width

     Requested by Michael Brand.

**** Better level cycling function

     =TAB= in an empty headline cycles the level of that headline
     through likely states.  Ryan Thompson implemented an improved
     version of this function, which does not depend upon when exactly
     this command is used.  Thanks to Ryan for this improvement.

**** Adaptive filling

     For paragraph text, =org-adaptive-fill-function= did not handle
     the base case of regular text which needed to be filled.  This is
     now fixed.  Among other things, it allows email-style ">"
     comments to be filled correctly.

     Thanks to Dan Hackney for this patch.

**** `org-reveal' (=C-c C-r=) also decrypts encrypted entries (org-crypt.el)

     Thanks to Richard Riley for triggering this change.

**** Better automatic letter selection for TODO keywords

     When all first letters of keywords have been used, Org now
     assigns more meaningful characters based on the keywords.

     Thanks to Mikael Fornius for this patch.

*** Clocking

**** Clock: Allow synchronous update of timestamps in CLOCK log

     Using =S-M-<up/down>= on CLOCK log timestamps will
     increase/decrease the two timestamps on this line so that
     duration will keep the same.  Note that duration can still be
     slightly modified in case a timestamp needs some rounding.

     Thanks to Rainer Stengele for this idea.

**** Localized clock tables

     Clock tables now support a new new =:lang= parameter, allowing
     the user to customize the localization of the table headers.  See
     the variable =org-clock-clocktable-language-setup= which controls
     available translated strings.

**** Show clock overruns in mode line

     When clocking an item with a planned effort, overrunning the
     planned time is now made visible in the mode line, for example
     using the new face =org-mode-line-clock-overrun=, or by adding an
     extra string given by =org-task-overrun-text=.

     Thanks to Richard Riley for a patch to this effect.

**** Clock reports can now include the running, incomplete clock

     If you have a clock running, and the entry being clocked falls
     into the scope when creating a clock table, the time so far spent
     can be added to the total.  This behavior depends on the setting
     of =org-clock-report-include-clocking-task=.  The default is
     =nil=.

     Thanks to Bernt Hansen for this useful addition.

*** Misc

**** Improvements with inline tasks and indentation

     There is now a configurable way on how to export inline tasks.
     See the new variable =org-inlinetask-export-templates=.

     Thanks to Nicolas Goaziou for coding these changes.

**** A property value of "nil" now means to unset a property

     This can be useful in particular with property inheritance, if
     some upper level has the property, and some grandchild of it
     would like to have the default settings (i.e. not overruled by a
     property) back.

     Thanks to Robert Goldman and Bernt Hansen for suggesting this
     change.

**** New helper functions in org-table.el

     There are new functions to access and write to a specific table field.
     This is for hackers, and maybe for the org-babel people.

     #+begin_example
     org-table-get
     org-table-put
     org-table-current-line
     org-table-goto-line
     #+end_example

**** Archiving: Allow to reverse order in target node

     The new option =org-archive-reversed-order= allows to have
     archived entries inserted in a last-on-top fashion in the target
     node.

     This was requested by Tom.

**** Org-reveal: Double prefix arg shows the entire subtree of the parent

     This can help to get out of an inconsistent state produced for
     example by viewing from the agenda.

     This was a request by Matt Lundin.
